Families
Crisis and Caring

Dr. T. Berry Brazelton has been called
our “national treasure.” Known and
beloved for his reassuring advice on the
universal issues of child care, he now
advises parents for the first time on major
family crises. Divorce and stepparenting,
infertility and adoption, life-threatening
illness in a child, the loss of one parent,
the single father, and issues of two cultures in an adoption are all examined in
depth in this candid and ground-breaking
book. Dr. Brazelton also explores two
other issues of special concern to twocareer couples — rivalry between the
parents for a child's affection and the

role of a nurturing, actively involved |
grandparent. |
Drawing on the dramatic lives of five real
families, Dr. Brazelton shows how each
crisis upsets the stability of a family, how
each member copes with the problem,
and most important, how they eventually
regain a balance and grow from the experience. An entire chapter is also devoted
to advice on when, why, and how an overwhelmed family can seek help. Parents
everywhere, regardless of their situation,
will feel invigorated and strengthened by
this wise book.

This is a book about real families and the ways they have handled
major challenges and crises. For all parents, creating and raising a
family consist of one adjustment after another. The ways that
strong, healthy familics handle these adjustments, whether large
F : ] : ones — adoption, serious illness, divorce — such as those described
AMIULES in this book, or small, predictable ones — teething, the first step,
Crisis an a Carin iy a new baby sitter — follow certain patterns. These universal patterns — of turmoil, regression, reorganization, and growth — can
be seen in the families which have couragcously and generously
. shared their experiences with me and with the reader. In their
stories we can see how the highs of parenting grow from conquering the low points, and how without the process of trial and

error these families would not be as strong today.

All parents worry about making mistakes. Not only are mistakes unavoidable, however, but parents learn their job through
mistakes. One reason it can be difficult for successful working
parents to adapt to child rearing is that the culture of the workplace
is often one of perfectionism and of dependable rewards. In raising

| a family, on the other hand, rewards are rarely dependable, although they are all the more joyous because of their unpredictability. Perfectionism and the systematic pursuit of success have no
place in parenting.

The families in this book have all had to face special and serious
kinds of stress. Not every family will face these problems, but all
families will have feared or dreamed abour them. The opportunity

we have to identify with these actual mothers and fathers as they
overcome their difficulties is their gift to us.
| As Robin and Chris Cutler acknowledge their feelings of ri| valry in the intense relationships that characterize their family —
rivalry with cach other and with their adopted son’s magical grandmother — they uncover feelings which all of us face as we become
a family. The Humphreys family is a successful stepfamily. In their

All five families originally appeared with me on the cable TV

the delightful and imaginative way she mothered everyone in this

family.
e& :

When I first met this family Chris talked to me openly about
his childhood longing for more time with his father — ume which
went to his father’s profession, architecture. Chris’s father worked
hard, was successful, and provided his sons with excellent educations and an example of dedication to a career. He worked and
played equally hard on the weekends: clearing woods, tennis, running, and teaching his sons endurance and agility. But his devotion
to work created a distance and an unfulfilled longing in Chris.
| Despite these feelings, it was obvious that his father had raised

She is much sought after and commands sizable fees. Robin is very
articulate and also spontancous. One has the feeling of instant
communication with her. I felt close to her right away. Her almost
childlike lack of inhibitions contrasts with the image of style and
competence which she also projects.

Chris recently changed jobs, from that of a management consultant to an administrative post at a local hospital. He made the
change in order to have more time at home with Wiley. He explained that he could see Wiley’s childhood slipping away as he
commuted to work for long hours and traveled around the Northcast, often away overnight. He recalled his relationship with his
own father, who also commuted long hours. He’d grown up longing to know his father better, and refused to repeat this with Wiley.
Hence, he had quickly reacted to Wiley’s arrival by searching out
employment close to home, making sure that he would have at
least part of every day with his family.

The fourth vital member of this family is Robin’s mother. Left
a widow with three small children, she went to work to support
them and became a much-admired teacher in a fine old private
school in Boston. She was able to raise the children, put them
through college, and see them established in successful careers
before she retired a few years ago. Now in her sixties, she is
energetic, elegant, and captivating. She has remained very close to

Chris,

Wiley is adopted. Robin and Chris were married for five years
before they started to plan a family. At that point, they expected
to be able to conceive right away. Robin had a miscarriage soon
after they started trying. After that miscarriage, nothing more happened. “It didn’t take us long to know we were in trouble,” said
Robin. “Each month, our anxiety built up. We went through all
the horrors of an infertility workup. I was determined to have
children and so was Chris. We each needed it for ourselves, but
also as a couple; we needed a child to share. At first, our friends
asked whether we were ever going to try. When we tried to answer
them honestly, they usually became uncomfortable and changed
the subject. It was as if we had a disease. Each of us tried to take
the blame, to protect the other — as if it were someone’s fault. Yet
there was no medical diagnosis, just ‘infertility, cause unknown.’
Everyone in our family got into the act. They sent us articles on
infertility. We learned that 1s to 20 percent of all couples are
infertile. That was reassuring. At least others had the same problem.
Forty to 45 percent of the problem is from the male; the rest is
due to the female. We started to feel very alone at family gatherings,
wanting to join our brothers’ and sisters’ little children with our
own. We were running on empty. We felt a huge chasm every time
we saw the others. We have tried now for eight years, and we had
to give up or try something else to save our sanity. The biological

that these feelings are healthy, in order to avoid endangering their
relationship. Men who assume that women have more nurturing
instincts are likely to overreact. | remember asking my wife if she
was sure she had enough breast milk — a question I would never
have asked a patient. In retrospect, I realize I was intensely jealous
of her and of the baby. In these and more subtle ways, men will
try to shove mothers aside. To protect themselves, women are likely
to criticize their husbands. Neither of these reactions is necessary,
if competitive feelings are understood. Instead, jealousy can be a
motivating force, energizing both parents to reach out to the child.
It needn’t be destructive. The baby can profit by this heightened
passion.

Diane Ehrensaft, in her book mentioned earlier, points out
interesting differences in the way parents behave with the same
child. Mothers commented on the clashing outfits that their husbands chose when they dressed the children. They were more likely
to match colors and took more pride in how their children looked.
Men, in turn, were scornful of their wives’ attention to appearance.
Each was expressing a measure of competition in a rather safe,
noncritical area.

Worrying is another arena in which parents are likely to differ
—and to compete. Mothers are more likely to worry in advance.
Men worry after something has already happened. Mothers tend
to feel that they are more closely in tune with children’s oncoming
adjustments. Men only identify when they can see something happen. Men are more likely to say, “At work, I have to forget about
what's happening at home. If I worry too much about the kids, I
can’t do my work well.” If there is indeed such a sex difference in
the way parents focus their concern, this could benefit children.
They could turn to mothers to prepare for a big adjustment, to
fathers for support as they make the adjustment. Each parent can

the toilet training area in the second year, it was just the reverse.
My wife had utter faith in their ultimate success in this area. So
the children tortured me with their “mistakes.” When one parent's
tension around an issue is balanced by a more relaxed attitude on
the part of the other, the child is cushioned against an obsessive
overconcern. By the same token, when both parents are uptight
about any one issue, it is more likely that the child sil develop a
problem in that specific area.

As Wiley declares his independence in the second year, Chris
and Robin are likely to experience it very differently. Robin feels
it deeply as a loss of the “love affair” of a baby’s first year. Chris
feels it as a kind of blossoming of Wiley’s masculinity. As the
separation progresses, however, Chris may reexperience the memories of his own father — with whom the alternating closeness and
separation was so painful. Now that Wiley has begun to establish
his own identity separate from his father’s, will Chris be able to let
him go? I felt that he was already hanging on to Wiley in a pretty
intense fashion. Maybe Robin senses this hanging on and feels
even more shut our as a result.

Robin’s mother, “Bommer,” was going to babysit. She came in
with Robin before they left. Robin was feeling the usual qualms
about leaving her toddler. And yet it was obvious to me that Wiley
and his grandmother are very close.

to you at all is really very sweet. To Robin. The
main thing is to tell him that even if you go
away, you're going to be back.

At this point, Bommer spoke coaxingly to Wiley about a walk
on the beach.

BOMMER Do you remember how you came to visit me

older in order to identify with him and de

DR. BRAZELTON This ts an example of concrete thinking. You
can say, “We all wish she’d come back. She
won't, but we can keep her alive in our minds.
Maybe that way, she'll know we are thinking
about her, and we'll feel her close by.” You can
assure her that a replacement wouldn’t be the
same and that you want to wait until you're
recovered somewhat before you even think
about another baby. You want that baby to be
special on her own, and not just a replacement
for her sister.

can reinforce in the child a sense of being different, left our. The
child is then likely to tease them in order to stir up strong feelings
that prove to him he’s really part of this family. Such teasing calls
out for a firm, but loving, reaction.

A mother in Liz’s position ts bound to worry about losing
her child, but she needn’t. He needs her and his new family and is
well aware of it. It is wise to avoid comparing the advantages and
privileges of one family te the other. A child will know which are
more real for him, but he needs both. Comparisons put a child on
the spot, as if he had to make a choice. A child of divorce can
never make a choice. He needs both parents, if they are available.
He needs them differently, and he can sort out these differences,
as long as he’s not made a pawn between them.

One of the most effective ways to give a child a sense of
belonging is to sct firm rules and to ask him to help out in specific
ways. The child will feel more a part of the family in which he
plays a useful and responsible role than he will in the one that
showers him with treats. The custodial family does not need to
compete at this level, for the child /ives there.

When a child returns from visiting the other parent, there are
three steps his family can take to make the reentry smoother.

When a baby is born to the new family, the relationship with
a stepparent is threatened again. If this is handled in an understanding way, the older child becomes able to form a strong attachment
to the new half-sister or -brother, as Chris has with Gillian. He
identifies with both his parents in becoming Gillian’s nurturer. He
may have felt shut out by her in one way, but it seems that he also
sees her as his entry into the family. When I saw them together,
he was proud and caring toward her. The fact that he can use her
to project his feelings and fear of rejection from his family when
he goes away to his other house shows that they are close. When
he comes home and avoids her, while pointedly asking about the
new baby, he is trying to hurt her. During Liz’s last pregnancy,
they formed an alliance — both positive and negative — as they both
faced a new invader. In this, they are acting like a real brother and
sister,

SHARING A CHILD AFTER Divorce. After the pain of
a disrupted marriage, a caring parent will inevitably want to make
it up to the children of that marriage. If she makes a second,
successful one, she will see the children of the first marriage as hurt
or potentially damaged. Liz had a “blissful few years” alone with
Chris. She is bound to feel that she must make up to him now for
what he (and she) feel as a disruption of that closeness. When he
shows any pain or any rebellion, she will unavoidably take it personally. A parent who cares as she does will blame herself for all
of the normal problems he would face at this age anyway. All of
this is unconscious, but she will inevitably compare the present,
rather thin, time, as she sees it, to the intensely close years they
had together when she was single. She will remember her son as
he was during this closeness and compare this memory with what
he is like after she “endangered him” by remarrying and deserting
him for a new family. The arrival of a new baby reminds a divorced
parent of the closeness she had with her first child. If the older
child acts out, either because of rivalry or because he is approaching
preadolescence, her feelings of loss and guilt will intensify.

At this point, many children who live with their mothers will
try to restore what they miss by turning to their own fathers. The

how I enjoyed meeting him again. He beamed. I asked him about
his summer. He mentioned visiting his father and then said, “I'm
lucky to have two families. It means I get more presents, have
twice as many friends — one at each house. I can have golf and
fishing with my father and basketball here!”

one of them. In fact, the atmosphere in this family as a whole feels
good. They are such caring, earnest people, and they are working
so hard and so well on their life together. I wished that all stepfamilies could be as supportive and as determined to work things out.

} OFFICE VISIT
On the next visit, Valerie brought in Lauren and Stephanie. After
catching me up on Kevin, she began to talk abour Lauren. She
was concerned about how much Kevin’s illness was affecting her.
| Lauren is a self-contained three-year-old. She arrived wearing a
| frilly dress, her hair curled. She looked around to be sure she was
| pleasing us — the picture of a good little girl. She dutifully put out
her hand to greet me.

VALERIE Lauren and Kevin had the usual sibling rivalries, but when Kevin got sick, she started catering to him. She gave in to his every little
wish. Even at two and a half, she was aware
of what he was going through. Whenever he
asked for something, she’d run and get it.

DR. BRAZELTON Did this come from imitating you guys?

VALERIE Yes, it probably did. Burt just a little while ago,
she began to change and get tough with him
again.

DR. BRAZELTON And what happened? Give me some sort of
sequence.

VALERIE As Kevin started to look better and feel better
and act better, she decided, “Wair a minute,
no more of this.” Because he was also taking
advantage of her.

Lauren, apparently an outgoing, happy child, changed to a quiet,
repressed one — all too sensitive and eager to please. She becomes
frantic when her mother leaves the house. These fears of being
deserted, of losing someone else, are very common among the

siblings of critically ill children.

in contact with Valerie’s every move. When Valerie’s face saddened
at one very poignant moment, Stephanie darted across the room
to look up into Valeric’s face, as if to say, “Its all right.” I have
seen this kind of role reversal, of the baby mothering the mother,
in other situations where the mother is depressed. Valerie handles
her feclings so well that it came as a surprise to see Stephanie’s
concern. I don’t think it hurts a toddler to be so sensitive to a
mother’s pain and so protective of her, bur it does demonstrate a
kind of social precocity. This is the toddler’s contribution to the
family’s coping system. I find it beautiful and remarkable.

The child, like Lauren, who its neither the sick one nor a baby
may suffer from these inhibitions the most. She is squeezed between a sick brother who is on everyone’s mind, and an openly
aggressive, provocative, one-year-old sister. In times of tragedy,

quickly how to hold the distracted parents’ attention. But an older

Having been successful in other areas, they are programmed for
success in this one, too. When it works as planned, they are unlikely
to be either surprised or grateful. Pregnancy fits their expectation
that “When we are ready, it will happen.”

When these midcareer, midthirtics couples become parents,
they can offer their baby an established, secure environment. They
can also offer the baby a model of inner security which they have
built up in these years of success. They are likely to become dedicated parents. At the same time, the vicissitudes of relating to a
baby and of accepting a deepened sense of responsibility often
throw them for a while. Couples at this age are likely to be rather
set in their ways, and yet cach new stage in the baby’s development
demands reorganization on their part. Therefore they are likely to
be anxious along the way as parents. For a pediatrician, they are
demanding as patients, because they care so much and want to do
everything well. They seek more advice than younger people do.
They work hard to understand the psychology of parenting and of
child rearing — often when there aren’t casy explanations. The
unknowns of parenting tend to upset them. They tend to hover
over the baby. Parenting demands both learning by mistakes and
letting a child do the same; young professionals who have planned
and controlled their lives up to this point must learn a new approach as parents. All this is not easy, but because these couples
are so eager to be parents, their powerful motivation helps them
learn fast. Their eagerness, anxiety, and turmoil loosens up their
set ways.

Sometimes, however, becoming a parent in the first place ts
hard. The long torment of infertiliry testing and attempted treatments undermines the expectation of success in couples like Barry
and Eileen. Taking a daily temperature to predict ovulation, holding off on sexual activity until the precise moment, wondering
whether potency will be maintained — all this routine clouds the
sexual act berween two caring people. Then, waiting each month

EILEEN I think that threat to our marriage made me
decide to stop trying to get pregnant. I tended
to be the one who felt the pressure most
acutely, I just couldn’t keep on trying. After
sixty-some cycles, I said, “That’s all! I can’t do
this anymore. I have to stop, because this is
making me crazy.” Once we made the decision
to adopt, it was liberating. I felt like we took
a very long, hard journey together and somehow made it through — came out the other

about having Jenny.

BARRY In fact, the first week — remember? The first

looking around.

her arms out straight, perfectly straight, like
she’s flying. EILEEN Yes. There was a period when she would look

me right in the eye and just give a blank expression, and then she would turn away and
go back to cooing, or whatever it was. It used
to break my heart. I thought, “Oh, my God.
She doesn’t like me!”

DR. BRAZELTON Now let's see you crawl.

For most babies, four months is a transition stage — from
automatic reflexes to more voluntary actions. Jenny is becoming
more actively motivated to get where she’s going. No longer is her
crawling automatic; she works toward a goal. By now, a lot of the
newborn reflexes, like the walking and crawling reflex, have
dropped out. Such reflexes are automatic, originating in a lower
part of the brain. By four months, they are being replaced by
deliberate motions: crawling, reaching, pushing. The behavior of
a four-month-old baby is a mixture of automatic and deliberate
actions.

DR. BRAZELTON With that kind of look, a baby can make you
feel inadequate. Ezleen’s real worry.

EILEEN The feeling that I got was that she wanted to
be back with her biological mother, She had

THE ISSUES

Adoption is a lifelong job — infinitely rewarding but tough at times.
Not only is the decision to adopt a major one, but the adjustment
to the role can be difficult. Adjusting to a new baby is hard for
any parent, but for adoptive parents there is an extra level of
adjustment because they usually have yearned to be parents for so
long. The more parents care about being the best possible parents
for their baby, the more they have to worry about.

In a pregnancy, the ferus’s development helps begin the adjustment. As the expectant parents prepare themselves with their
wishes, their dreams, their anxicties, the fetus begins to move. The
movement and the baby’s stvle i utero help the parents experience
the reality of the coming baby. Before an adoption, parents also
dream and form wishes and fears about what the baby will be like.
They are afraid it won't be normal, won't be like them. Today,
with our rapidly increasing knowledge of the effects of intrauterine
experiences — such as malnutrition, drugs, smoking, caffeine, infections — adoptive parents are bound to worry about what their
baby has been exposed to before they are able to take over. How

EILEEN When she sees me, she almost looks delighted.
DR. BRAZELTON Say something without coming closer, Barry.
BARRY Softly. “Hello, hello.”

DR. BRAZELTON Watch Jenny's shoulders go up, she gets sort
of giddy when she hears him; there’s a whole
ditterent language between the two of them.

Jenny arched her shoulders, her eyebrows, as if she knew
Barry’s voice and anticipated his coming to play with her.

DR. BRAZELTON For Jenny, this is a very overwhelming new
world and very scary. When she arrived, you
wanted to get to her so quickly that you may
have pushed too hard and made her pull back.

of them has dreamed of a baby that looks like one or the other of
them. Such dreams will never entirely vanish. Bur they must give
up, as much as possible, this imaginary baby, in order to be available to their real baby. Otherwise, they will constantly compare
the adopted baby to the one that might have been. For instance,
whenever Jenny does something that reminds Barry of Eileen, he
may catch himself before he blurts our, “She’s just like you!” Or if

Jenny begins to imitate her father’s playful giggles, Eileen may
pause before she says, “She’s learning to imitate your giggle!” The

DR. BRAZELTON One should always talk about it. There is never
a best time. By three or four years, a child will
have specific questions, and you should be prepared to answer them. “Where do I come
from? Why didn’t my parents want me? Were
they bad? Will I ever get to meet my parents?
Are you my real mother and father?” Such
questions are inevitable, so it is wise to prepare
for them. If you don’t know much abour the
real parents, tell the child what you do know.
Meet every question as honestly and directly
as you can. The questions of an adopted child
must be treated with respect. If asked why a
mother might give up her child, you can feel
secure in saying “to give you a better future
than she could provide.” or, if such was the
case, that “she was unmarried and couldn't
provide the family that she wanted for you.”

ture and stress its strengths to him. When he’s
older, he can learn more on his own. A child
with a sure sense of his own cultural heritage
will be proud of it.

DR. BRAZELTON You might answer, “How could anyone not
love you? She would if she knew vou. I wanted
you because I could see how wonderful you
were. I wanted to be your family, and I am.
I'm part of your family, and you're part of
mine. I'll never leave you nor you me. If you
ever want to find vour birth mother, Pll help
you. But you'll still be part of my family.” A
child needs to know that she ts, and deserves
to be, treasured, since the threat of desertion
always looms for adopted children. The other |
thing a child needs to know is that she is part
of a real family and will always be. An adopted
child often reasons that if one mother can send
her away, the adoptive parent might also — |
particularly if she’s bad. Too many adoptive
children suppress any negative feelings or neg- |
ative behaviors for fear of being rejected again.

QUESTION We learned quite suddenly that our baby
daughter was ready for us about two wecks
before she came. So we rushed out to buy
everything — clothes, a crib, and so on. But at
the time, I got a strong sad feeling. It was
almost like an anxiety attack. I really couldn’t
explain it, and I wondered why I felt that way
before she came, when I should have been so

| excited.

DR. BRAZELTON The anxiety and depression that come with
such a major step as an adoption is the other
side of the coin. Elation often dominates, but
anxiety is normal, as well. During this time,
you are still working to give up the fantasy of
a natural child. So anxiety and even depression
are part of the adjustment. If one can acknow!edge these feelings, as you are doing, the adjustment will be more complete. This
ambivalence is part of an “alarm” reaction,

DR. BRAZELTON A two-year-old is likely to become negative
when he gets sure enough of himself, so negativism and temper tantrums will be a good
sign of his recovery. At first, he’s bound to be
withdrawn and depressed. If he’s had a good,
nurturant foster placement, he’ll mourn about
the readjustment and is likely to mourn for at
least a month or so, before he will allow you
to get close to him. His mourning will probably not take the form of open weeping or
resistance; it will be a more passive withdrawal. You should feel relieved when he lets
you see other sides of him. If he’s had a bad
placement previously, he will be disorganized
and difficult to engage or to relate to, He may
be unruly or unreachable at first. He may resist
being held or cuddled, because he once lost all
that and it’s too painful. You must be patient
and persistent, but sensitive to how afraid he
may be to trust the kind of loving you want
to give him. The morc he longs for it, the
more he may need to resist it. Your wooing

them. But never let her feel that she can actually get rid of her brother just because she
wishes to. That would frighten her, indeed. As
you enlist her help, give her as much understanding of your son’s situation as you can.
Let her see when she ts making it with her
new brother, and encourage her to believe they
will have a good time in the long run. Leave
them to work out their rivalry on their own.
They'll get to be better friends, and more
quickly, if you stay out of their relationship.
As he begins to become more secure, he'll start
acting out. Your reaction will probably be:
“This is what he learned from his previous
home. I don’t want her exposed to it.” It won't
hurt her. She may even imitate him, but she
won't assume his behavior permanently. As she
mimics him, she will be getting closer to him,
learning more about him. As he expresses his
negative feelings, he will become more secure.
So your job is to let all this happen.

nurturing was coupled with frequent breastfeeding to quiet newborns if they cried.

As I studied such qualitative differences from one culture to
another, I saw both genetic and environmental influences at work.
The genetic predisposition to certain kinds of motor responses and
to a certain threshold for taking in and utilizing sensory stimuli
has already been shaped during pregnancy by the mother’s movements, the environment around her, and the quality of her reactions
to this environment. In the quiet, primitive fisherman’s villages on
the Goto Islands, pregnant women are protected from too much
sumulation. In Tokyo, where the pace of life and the level of
stimulation is similar to that of U.S. cities, there 1s already a slight

at first it was because she'd never been played with in her previous

I have noticed in my own practice that parents who make a
cross-racial adoption must work harder than others to understand
their baby and the qualitative difference in behavior in rhythms, in

of. How likely is it that my son will also have
a problem with overweight as he gets older?

DR. BRAZELTON Quite likely. The body type of parents is very
likely to be dominant and heritable. It doesn’t
always follow, for there are recessive genes
which can appear. But it would be surprising
if he didn’t have a body type like yours. So it
is important for him to learn weight control
early. It won't happen by your manipulating
him and what he eats. That is more likely to
cause rebellion in him and overeating in the
long run. He will learn by modeling himself
on your behavior. If you can learn to watch
your diet, without making an issue out of it,
in all likelihood he'll mimic you. If you can set
an example in activity and sports, he is more
likely to value these. The combination of a
controlled diet and regular sports is the surest
way to avoid obesity.

QUESTION My daughter has a tendency to be very aggressive with other children. She may be trying
to give them a hug, but she ends up knocking
them down. Does this mean she'll be aggressive as she gets older?

DR. BRAZELTON I hope not. It needn't lead to aggression. She
doesn’t mean it now. However, if her approach
frightens other children and their reaction in
turn frightens her, patterns of anxious overreaction may get started. This might lead her
to bully other children. I'd certainly help her
to see that other children don’t like roughness.
Pd warn her before you go somewhere exciting that you'd like to help her find ways to
control herself. And Pd practice them with her.
Don’t overreact when she fails, but do let her

The O’Connell-Beder Family

know you won’t allow her to hurt others, and
even remove her from the situation, if necessary. One of the best ways to help her will be
to find another child just like her and let them
play together. They'll learn rapidly from each
other. Then you can help her learn how to
approach less aggressive children. It’s not that
you should quell any aggression in her, but
you can help her channel it into acceptable
behavior, so that she will be liked by others
and can like herself. Learning how to live with
and control aggressive feelings is a lifelong
process. If a child is afraid of getting out of
control, she is more likely to hold back and
then explode, and to become an uncomforta
bly aggressive person.

quietly animated. Cocking her head slightly, she looked directly at
me, smiling broadly, a dimple in her left cheek. She talked in full
YY | sentences, complicated ones for a three-year-old. Later, I realized
how much she was like Eileen in her charm, both compelling and
sophisticated. It was almost as if she were an Asian version of her
mother’s smiling Irish charm. The contrast between their looks
made this likeness astonishing,

Before long, I found myself enthralled with them all. Barry’s
reserved, intelligent style was the anchor of this trio. Jenny’s
wooing of me told me how secure she was with him. In my office,
I can soon tell how a child relates to her father by the way she
deals with me. As we communicated, she began to settle cozily
into our new relationship. She showed self-assurance, as well as a
sense of joy, which I began to feel with her as well. The way a
small child relates to a male physician or male family friend is
almost always based on her past experience with the important
man in her life. Children whose fathers are really involved with
them grow up with a sense of trust which I can sense even in my
bricf contacts in the office.

Eileen told me about their life now. They adopted John fifteen
months ago from the same Korean adoption agency that sent them
Jenny. He, too, was three months old when he came over, The
foster family who'd cared for him sent them pictures of themselves
with him as a newborn, his teddy bear, and Korean costumes for
him to wear when he was a few years older. They urged the Beders
to send them pictures of him as he grew. The fact that he’d been
with people who cared about him gave Eileen and Barry a good
feeling.

Eileen is working only one day a week now, seeing patients
in psychotherapy. She’s a homemaker the rest of the time. Barry
stays home two days a week to be with his family. The Beder
Health Clinic, which runs programs for businesses and for individuals who want to stop smoking or drinking, as well as tor other
kinds of personal crisis management, is besieged with consulting
work. Barry used to travel a great deal before the children came.
Now he rarely leaves home.

Together, Barry and Eileen are working on a videotape to
demonstrate some of his ideas and techniques for giving up smok
As I arrived at Eileen and Barry’s small two-story house in a Boston
suburb, I looked up the steep stairway to the porch above, Standing
there to greet me were three of the family: Eileen, Barry, and threeyear-old Jenny. A neighbor who was passing by saw me looking
at them. “What a pretty picture!” she said. I had to agree. They
are a striking trio, Eileen, with her strawberry blond hair and huge
blue eyes, is a magazine editor’s ideal of beauty. But she sparkles
with warmth and welcome as well. Barry’s dark, trim looks project
quiet strength. Then Jenny, with her square body, her fine Asian
features and straight black hair, becomes a third contrast. Her black
eyes look wary as you approach, Each of them greeted me from
the porch, but Jenny drew back to hide behind her parents’ legs.
She stared at me stonily for the first fifteen minutes after I arrived,
not allowing me close to her. I turned away to talk to her cordial
parents.

After we'd entered their house and had sat down at the table
so that I could take notes, I felt a soft hand on my leg. Jenny was
making a bid for my attention. As soon as I responded, she began
to communicate. As if we'd lifted a foodgate, she began to show
me her toys, to draw for me, to tell me her “secrets.” For the rest
of the visit, she acted as if I were there for her, and kept busy
charming me. She chartered almost incessantly. Whenever I began
to get immersed in conversation with her parents, her chatter
became insistent, as if she were determined to keep adult attention.
I wondered whether this wasn’t her way of competing with John,
her eighteen-month-old brother, who was asleep in another room.

Eileen told me that Jenny was famous for charming all their
friends. I could believe it. When her delightful chatter failed, she’d
insinuate herself physically. She would glide up to my knee, gently
put her hand on my leg, and look piercingly at me with her dark
eyes. I found her irresistible. I could hardly keep from either picking her up or leaning over to talk to her. It was dithcult to converse
with her parents. The moment I responded to her, she became

insensitive to us that people think Asian children all look alike. It
seems as if people don’t even look. We love their individuality.”

“Unfortunately, they will have to face it over and over,” I said.
“They do look different from the children around them. At school,
that will bother other children who will be sorting out their own
individual ditterences. Your role will be to reassure them of their
individuality, of the importance of their background and their
culture, but also of their complete acceptance here within your
family.”

“Tve already dealt with the difference between us as a Catholic
and a Jew. Our families had a hard enough time with our marriage:
‘Will you circumcise your boys? Will you baptize your babies?” We
had to help them with those adjustments, and in the process, we
came to understand our own feelings about differences. Now we
are better prepared to help the kids.”

“Do your families accept them now?” I asked.

“Oh, yes,” said Eileen. “They call about them all the time. My
sister’s son is one month apart from John in age, and my brother
has a daughter two weeks younger than Jenny. Jenny will be going
to the same school as her cousin. They are devoted to each other.
They are very much a part of our extended family, and the kids are
devoted to each other.”

“They are indeed lucky children,” I said.

“Well, we're lucky, too,” said Barry. “They've really cemented
our family. We go around as a pack now — four of us as a group.
We've never been happier together — Eileen and I. We feel a sense
of fulfillment P'd never dreamed of.” Eileen nodded vigorously, “I
stay home two working days, clean the house, and do some cooking
— to help Eileen, but also to be a real part of the family.”

“His male friends are very threatened by this,” Eileen said with
a smile. “They call and say, “Would you clean our house, too?’ or
‘Cut it out — you're getting us into trouble.’ They are really threatened.”

“It doesn’t bother me anymore,” said Barry. “It did at first, I
must admit. But I realized that when we found we couldn’t have

Jenny, I was still wondering, ‘Am I OK to be someone’s father?’
Now, I’m very proud of being a good father. It more than makes
up for any failure. John calls us both Mama.”

“If ’'m not home for a few days,” Barry went on, “I forget
where things are. I need to be here for my own sake, to keep my
hand in. The only tme I feel torn is when Eileen calls me at the
office, when ['m running a session with a high-powered group of
executives. She calls and says, “The children want to talk to you!’ I
have to stop to talk children’s talk. But I know what rewards I’ve
gotten from all of this, so I figure these executives could take a
lesson from it themselves.”

Meanwhile, Jenny was crawling up into my lap, her jamcovered fingers exploring my face, determined to know all she could
about me. I commented on how secure she feels about men. Barry
said proudly, “We have such a good time together. We play for an
hour at a time. I get a real high from playing with her.”

“Does the high worry you?” I asked. “Today, everyone worries
so much about sexual feelings, about abuse, that some fathers feel
inhibited when they play with their daughters.”

“Well,” said Barry, “I do feel slightly uneasy when she crawls
into bed with me. After my psychiatric training, it’s hard not to
be self-conscious when she says things like, “I like your penis!” But
I know down deep how secure and clear our relationship is, so I'm
not really threatened by it. I see it as her way of knowing me
better. I hope I don’t pass on any sense of embarrassment.”

“She’s such a direct little girl,” added Eileen. “She said the
other day, ‘I don’t like this baby anymore. Send him back on the
plane. I want to be your only doctor child!”

“She is such a blessing,” Barry went on. “She’s made me feel
personally intact again. And she’s put our marriage on an entirely
different basis. We could have drifted apart so easily in all that
stressful period. Now we are committed to each other at an entirely
different level. I see Eileen as a good mother. She sees me as a
good father. It gives us a whole new level of assurance. We are
happier than ever now.”

acrobatics. They are so well coordinated that it is stunning to watch
them move and perform. John, who now appeared from his nap,
followed night behind, imitating her every movement, with early
signs of the same coordination and motor ability thar Jenny has.

Eileen and Barry proudly talk about these noticeable gifts and
want to foster them. They want to introduce Jenny to some training, but they have run into a kind of stubborn resistance in her. “J
want to do it,” she says when anyone tries to show her anything
about acrobatics. They will have to introduce her to lessons carefully. I sense that they want her to develop this special skill as a
way of helping her face the teasing about differences that she will
get from her peers. However, she must be ready for lessons, and
not pushed into a learning situation. At some later point, she may
well show a hunger for instruction and more skill. Musicians have
told me that a talented child is usually ready for lessons and for
the discipline of practicing by the age of five or six, but not before.
Jenny must first develop a sense of her own talent, of things she
can do well, by herself. Then, she will be receptive to a sensitive
teacher, who can help her develop this talent. Barry and Eileen’s
admiration and joy in her beautiful coordination will reinforce it
enough at this time. I encouraged them to wait for signs of readiness in her.

It’s all too easy to push a three-year-old child to learn a new
skill — such as acrobatics or reading or writing. If Eileen and Barry
started her on lessons now, she'd learn. Pve seen children who
learned to read and write at three and four years, or to perform
physically or musically at this age. They are trying to please the
adults around them. But they aren’t necessarily getting an inner
pleasure from this learning. As Jenny says, “J want to do it.” When
they are older, this kind of early training may even interfere with
learning. Precocious learning patterns don’t always generalize to
later, more complicated learning patterns. A child like Jenny will
get more inner satisfaction from playing and exploring different
uses of her body in spontaneous antics. Play ts a child’s way of
learning. While playing, children are always experimenting. They
drop the techniques which don’t work and continue to improve
the ones that do. If Eileen and Barry pushed her to learn now, her
own inner excitement about mastering her body might be sub
merged. Eileen and Barry would do well to respect Jenny’s stubborn refusal and to foster her learning via play and in interaction
with her peers, rather than with adult teachers. A child’s job in the
preschool years is to learn about herself, not to learn to compete
or to learn complex skills that can come later.

As I was preparing to leave, Jenny became a bit more clinging,
as if she didn’t want me to go. She led me upstairs to her bedroom,
where she showed a picture and said proudly, “That’s me and you!”
She was right. There was a picture someone took in my office of
me, and of her as a baby with Eileen and Barry. We were smiling
and looking down at this serious, new baby who'd just been flown
in from the Orient. She was watching us all worriedly as we
overreacted, trying to reach her. I realized how sensitively, and how
far, Eileen and Barry had come in adjusting to this lovely girl. At
three, she was already outgoing, self-assured, and thoroughly at
home.

for the family. As we have seen through the stories in this book,
the process of openly airing a problem with an objective person |
outside the family may illuminate the issues, without the need for !
formal therapy. This primary caretaker may also refer parents to a
support group of families in the same situation, such as Parents
Without Partners, associations of stepparents, or groups for adoptive parents.
Some families will be fortunate enough to find a pediatrician
who can offer what is called “anticipatory guidance.” In preparing
for a change such as the adoption planned by the O’Connell-Beder
family and the Cutlers, the arrival of a new baby in a blended
family, or the approach of adolescence in a single-parent family like
the Coopers, it is of immense value to have as much information
and backup as possible. A pediatrician can prepare a family beforehand for the stresses of such adjustments and can acquaint parents
with what to expect and let them see their reactions as universal.
He or she can prepare them for their own inevitable anxieties. By
doing so, the physician also helps them recognize when their reactions get out of the normal range. With advance preparation, a
family is in much better shape to handle a change.

she will focus on the successes and previous strengths in the family
and build on these to handle the present crisis. If the therapist
appears to be most concerned with the failures, I would recommend seeking a more balanced person.

Therapy for an individual child should be considered when
the child is frightened or withdraws and cannot be reached by the
parents, or when emotional or psychosomatic symptoms interfere
with his or her functioning — in school, with peers, or with siblings.
If a child seems not to play actively, or to be enjoying it less, this
can also be a warning sign. The great British child analyst D. W.
Winnicott wrote that “if a child is playing, there is room for a
symptom or two, and if a child is able to enjoy play, both alone
and with other children, there is no very serious trouble afoor.”*
Another sign that a child needs help is the reactions of other
children. If they consistently shy away, they are sensing the child’s
upset. He or she will, in turn, sense their rejection, and this can
become a vicious cycle of isolation.

Therapy can be a major opportunity for the whole family to
look backward to past achievements, to consolidate strengths, and
Sabie age to reorganize at a new level of fulfillment. Not only is it worth

For families secking help for a crisis or a problem affecting
more than one member of the family, such as those described in
this book, there is also a choice between individual therapy, for the
child or one parent, or family therapy. The advice of a pediatrician
or nurse, the parents’ own sense of where the problem lies, and
their intuitive preference for, or sense of comfort in, a group or
individual situation will guide this choice.
