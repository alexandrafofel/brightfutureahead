Moments of Meeting 77

Anton had just opened his eyes upon hearing his mother’s voice. I
seize the opportunity and show her, “Yes... yes . . . and did you see
now? He opened his eyes, too, to look where you were!”

The mother watches the baby, bends forward and begins to speak
melodiously, “Anton! Anton, hello! Hello, darling, are you awake?”
Anton opens his eyes again and raises his gaze toward his mother.
He searches for her for almost 10 seconds. Then he becomes more
animated and raises his head. I congratulate him: “Good! Here we go!”
The mother praises him and calms him down. “Did you see that?” T ask.
Both parents nod.

Anton begins to crawl, and I suggest to the mother, “If you stand at

the other side of the bed, he will come to you.” This is an opportunity for
a moment of meeting! The mother moves to the other side of the bed, and
Anton does crawl toward her. She congratulates him and kisses him.
I admire this feat, too, “Look at this! Do you want to take him in your
arms?” I want to help the moment of meeting to bloom. The mother gathers
him in her arms; her mood has lightened noticeably. “How nice my
baby is!” she says. “My nice baby!” With a gesture of his hand, the father
joins this moment of meeting and also admires his son. “Brave!” he says
simply. I notice that this is his way of being part of the meeting, joining in with
his own thoughts, but allowing the central place to remain the mother’s. The
mother hugs her son . . . kisses him and talks to him. The father participates quietly in this intense moment.

I comment, “This is the greatest happiness!” The mother keeps her
son close in her arms and smothers him with kisses. I give time for the
moment of meeting to unfold. I feel happy and relieved, even though I am not
done with the NBAS and will resume it when the mother’s emotions recede a
bit from this crest.

This is a four-person moment of meeting. At the beginning of the
exam, the mother expressed her anxiety when she said that Anton didn’t
open his eyes, didn’t hold his head as well as his brother, and didn’t look
toward her when being breastfed. Through the NBAS, Anton responded
to his mother’s concern by acting. He was indeed able to emerge from
his sleep. Attracted by his mother’s voice, he summoned up all his
energy to hold his head and look at her and to crawl toward her. Deeply
relieved, she expressed a deep surge of love and sought closeness with
her baby. All four of us had shared a positive experience that is now
registered in the family’s history.

GENERAL COMMENTARY ON THE CLINICAL EXAMPLES

The orientation behavior of the baby toward his mother is a strong
trigger for the mother’s attachment. The baby crawls toward her;
when she picks him up, he molds his warm little body against
her; he twists his neck to look at her and listens to her with great

## Page 4

78 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

attention when she speaks. This behavior delivers a message
that the mother understands at a psychological level; it makes the
mother feel that he is interested in her, that he has chosen her, and
that he loves her. Effectively, when the baby’s gaze finds his
mother’s, this moment of meeting releases a flow of love. One can
feel it; it is almost palpable. It is the clinician’s reward.

This moment of meeting answers the mother’s question, which
is the second theme of the Motherhood Constellation—wondering
if she will be able to bond with her child. “Will I love you? Will you
love me? Will I know that you love me? Will you recognize me?
Will we click? Will we connect?”

The infant’s behavior is one more building block nature puts
into place in order to construct a positive bond that feeds representations of the baby as being gratifying, of the mother as being competent, and of the father as having a competent and harmonious
family that he feels good about.

The NBAS consultation always includes the father; he is part of
the team. When he witnesses a moment of meeting between the
baby and his mother, the father is usually relieved to discover his
partner’s competencies, the harmony of her communication
and relationship with their child. It pulls him closer to her. It can
also trigger a moment of meeting between mother and father
in their new role of co-parents. Even though moments of meeting
between father and baby are much less frequent, the father may
often be inspired by witnessing one of them; and he may try, later,
to connect with his infant in the same way. For all these reasons, the
father’s presence is essential.

Beyond the establishment of the bond, what I find fascinating is
the mother’s discovery of her baby as an interlocutor, someone
who listens to her and with whom she can communicate. He is no
more considered only as a beloved object of care, but as a life companion with whom she can share her thoughts because she has discovered that he is endowed with affective receptivity. And the same
is valid for the father. This early openness to affective and fuller
communication may allow for more fluid exchanges later on.

UNDERLYING THEORY
It is now understood that the process of establishing the parent-infant
tie, the attachment process, is vital for survival and for mental health.
These processes begin at birth, and for this reason my work focuses
on their initial steps in the neonatal period. The quality of early

## Page 5

Moments of Meeting 79
attachment and the coherence of the transmitted and remembered
experience starts to form from the very beginning. The ties and
attachment form mostly in a nonverbal language (only the parents
have words). Accordingly, attachment is situated in the implicit
domain. This nonverbal language is made up of the affects—the
rhythms of interaction and their transitions, the play of gaze,
the facial expressions, the gestures, the physical positions, the vocalizations, and everything the body expresses. It is in this interactive
space that the baby constructs the world of his knowledge of how to
be with others and how they are with him—the style of exchanges
with others. This is called “implicit relational knowing.”°?"*

One of the central concerns here is how and when changes
occur that advance the attachment process. It is recognized that
such changes are usually unpredictable and occur in a leap, not in
a continual progression. What is the best way to describe such
discontinuous phenomena? The BCPSG explores the change process on a scale of seconds during development and in psychotherapy. We define an NM as a moment of crisis where all energy is
mobilized in managing the very moment. The NM arises at the
crossroad marked by a time-limited opportunity for the individual to act. He can grapple with his destiny, flee it, or do nothing
(fight, flight, or freeze). Whichever course he takes will change his
destiny. Such a time window for action is called kairos by the
ancient Greeks. An individual can let himself be carried by the
events and submit to them passively, or he can act on them, adequately or not. He can let himself be guided by his instinct or by
the advice of others. In any case, he is the agent of his own destiny, and his destiny is being played out now.

The birth of one’s own infant is an NM or a moment of kairos par
excellence. It involves a challenge to who you are and an opportunity to become who you want to be. This realization can help parents take their destiny in hand, especially in situations when their
own infancy has been difficult. It gives them a chance to correct a
trajectory initiated in the past.

Steps in the advancement of the attachment process occur not
only in the infant’s and parents’ behavior, but also in their minds—
their representations of themselves, of the others, and of their
relationships. It is thus necessary to have a model that can deal
with these parallel but interrelated changes within the triad.
Figure 7.2 provides an example of such a model.

The representations are the result of past and present experiences; these determine, in large part, the behavior of each parent.

On his side, the baby constructs his representational world from
the experience lived in his interactions.

Certain aspects of the parents’ representational world will influ
ence their triadic interactions, including:

e The recent past history of the baby (the pregnancy, the delivery,
first contacts, breastfeeding) and his current state (his physical
state and health status, his state of alertness and activity).

e The history of each parent, which may include assisted procreation, an undesired pregnancy or one with much ambivalence, mourning over a previous pregnancy, other traumatic
experiences of loss or damage to another baby, step-children
from a previous marriage, a handicap in the family, meaningful loss, and so forth. It also includes the quality of attachment
with their own parents (the nature of the mother’s attachment
to her own mother, which is particularly active at this time,
and with her own father; and, similarly, the father’s attachment with his parents).

e The relationship of the couple, including their culture of origin, preexisting level of harmony, marital state, and so forth.

e The richness and harmony of ties to the extended family and
friends.

¢ Work and economic means as they affect child care.

The presence of the examiner multiplies the complexity of all this

considerably. She brings her own personal history (Does she have
children?), her professional training (pediatrician, psychologist,

## Page 7

Moments of Meeting 81
nurse), her clinical experience, and, importantly, her personality
and style.

This model argues for the presence of both parents during the
NBAS. It requires attention to their affects, behaviors, and representations. It is this combination of information sources that helps
inform the intervention.

WHY EARLY INTERVENTION?

Bringing a baby into the world is, for the mother, a profound
upheaval. For the rest of her life, she will be responsible for him.
The Motherhood Constellation takes place and acts on the mother’s psychology. It is a sort of mutation into another form of herself,
with no possible return. This is a normal maturational life crisis
that is extremely demanding. Understanding the new forces within
the mother brought about by the Motherhood Constellation throws
light on maternal anxiety. Her concern for her baby is due to a high
level of maternal vigilance, which is probably biologically programmed to protect the infant and ensure his survival.

The stress of their personal transformation mobilizes a lot of
energy from the parents. They need consideration and strong support. However, the time surrounding birth is commonly considered
as one of the happiest times in life. Given the fact that, as time
passes, memories of difficulties are often erased, the family and
social environment doesn’t appreciate the frailty of the new parents and their necessary adjustment process. The environment
often underestimates this very real difficulty and doesn’t offer the
needed support. All the ancient rituals around birth and the welcoming of the baby have almost disappeared, such as the relevailles,
which is the ceremony performed at church when a woman first
returns after the birth of her child; the presentation to the family;
the baptism; and so forth. They served as acts of acknowledgment
and support for the new parents.

The transition to parenthood, like all transformations, implies a
lot of uncertainties and opens the way to many misunderstandings
and inaccurate attributions. It is hard to build a parent’s new
identity without the benevolent regard of experienced others who
take the time to revisit with them the paths of their own metamorphoses. The construction of a coherent family history about the
foundational event of the birth puts in place a solid base for
the construction of the attachment between the family members
and for their life together. It is a communal experience to which
they can refer in the future.

## Page 8

82 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

The encounter with their baby, long awaited, is a decisive
moment for the parents. This little person, all new, still unknown,
will become part of their lives forever. They have dreamed of him,
thought about him, and sometimes been apprehensive of his coming. They need to discover who he is, to feel that he is coming
toward them to meet, to feel him responding to them in order to
enhance their ties and mutual love.

The period surrounding a birth rides on a crest of happiness
where the balance is uncertain, even very fragile. Many times, the
meeting fails or is delayed. Sometime these troubles are easy to
surmount thanks to a constellation of favorable factors. But if not,
even a banal event can be misunderstood and can lead the family
triad into a negative spiral that will leave a mark on its history. The
emergence of new responsibility for the life and the well-being of a
newborn, which has not been learned, adds additional pressure to
the other difficulties. Under these circumstances, when feelings of
confusion, exhaustion, and impotence accumulate, it is easy to slip
toward and get submerged in anxiety, panic, feelings of isolation,
depression, marital conflicts, or desperate enactments. One of the
aims of the intervention described here is to act on the moments
that can correct a downward spiral and open the way to a positive
one.!¢

Without going into all the therapeutic targets of this complex
time in life, the main guidelines of this approach and the objectives
of the intervention are:

1. To establish a coherent sense of self with competencies for

autonomy, as an agent, an entity, a whole person.

2. To feel related through shared experiences. To feel attached
through interpersonal events and connected through intersubjective experiences. Moments of meeting contribute to
building this sense of relatedness.

These two paths show the basic bipolarity of social life, namely

to feel autonomous and attached at the same time.
CONCLUSION

This view is based on the notion that the development of relatedness

is not something that grows progressively like a tree. Rather, it is a

discontinuous process made up of NMs and moments of meeting.

Moments of meeting are special moments that permit the relation
ship to jump to a higher level. My intervention with the NBAS aims

## Page 9

Moments of Meeting 83
to facilitate and promote such moments and attempts to use them
clinically for the purpose of early bonding and attachment.

The baby has the competencies to establish ties with his parents
and, at the same time, to develop his own autonomy. When they
recognize the bipolarity of his competencies, the parents are in a
better position to understand their baby and to build harmonious
ties with him.

Finally, in this approach emphasizing moments of meeting, I try
to bring to light one of the main objectives of the NBAS as I have
described my use of it. It is an aspect of Brazelton’s work—implicit in
his practice—that he uses intuitively and informally. When he does a
rapid demonstration of the Scale, he may omit certain items. But he
never forgets to ask the mother to speak to her baby, so that she has
the pleasure (and he does, too) of seeing the baby turn his head
toward her. However, this gesture, which is perhaps the most important of the whole intervention, has not yet been formally integrated
in the administration of the test. In this chapter, I have tried to show
some of the theory and practice that underlies such relation-building
moments in the use of the NBAS. They can be very powerful.

The Developmental Niche
of the Newborn in
Rural Kenya
CHARLES M. SUPER anp SARA HARKNESS

There was a time—as many contributors to this volume will
remember—when it was possible to think of the newborn as a
purely biological creature, free, for at least a little time, from human
culture. Prenatal influences were acknowledged, but they were
generally considered isolated variables operating at the biological
level. Culture entered the developmental equation only as part of
socialization, a process of little apparent importance in the early
months of life. It is now increasingly recognized, however, that culture permeates all aspects of human development, from the act of
conception through the ceremonies surrounding death. Progress in
understanding how this is true, and by what means culture influences development, depends ultimately on appropriately focused
comparative research. In this age of globalization, there is an
urgency to the pursuit of that research because our theories of
development need greater perspective to accommodate the broader
reality that is now difficult to ignore.’* In addition, social policies
that unwittingly rest on the expectation of a homogeneous population are rapidly becoming obsolete and counterproductive.’ The
The original research discussed here was supported in part by the W. T. Grant
Foundation, the Spencer Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, and the
National Institutes (United States) of Mental Health and of Child Health and
Human Development (grants RO1 MH 33285 and RO1 HD 38357). All statements made and views expressed are the sole responsibility of the authors.

newborn period is not too early a place to examine the role of
culture in development.

What should we be looking for? LeVine* has suggested that seeking and describing variation in child development is an opening
phase of the comparative enterprise, and many neonatal reports
from around the globe—found here and in earlier volumes—
contribute to that phase. Subsequent and more difficult, however,
is the challenge of accounting for differences and similarities in a
way that advances a deeper theoretical understanding of development.° That challenge requires developing an insightful tool for
parsing the child’s cultural surround.

CULTURE

Culture has been conceptualized in many ways by anthropologists,
varying in focus on historical continuity, physical artifacts, patterns
of daily life, organized variation, and shared systems of knowledge
and meaning.°’**!° For the developmentalist, the key insight concerns the integrative aspects of culture—a complex of particular
beliefs and practices that function as a system and that are shared
by a group of people who recognize each other as members of the
same group. The coordinating aspect of culture organizes a child’s
environment, and the power of culture to shape human development is a direct result of this organizing role.'"!”"* More than
any momentary event or single environmental feature, it is the
coordinated repetition of experiences over time, directly and indirectly, in ways large and small, that ensures that the message of culture is conveyed to the next generation.”

We have found it helpful to think of the child’s cultural environment as being structured by three interlocking subsystems: the
physical and social settings that are the stage of everyday life;'°
the customs of child care and education (in the broadest sense) that
are routinely employed and considered normal by adults in the
community;'° and the psychology of the caretakers, especially their
ethnotheories, or motivating beliefs and concepts that are shared
with other caretakers.” Together, this structure is referred to as the
developmental niche (see Figure 8.1). Three critical features of
the niche highlight its dynamics.'*’*'® First, there is pressure for the
three subsystems to operate in harmony. For example, parents do
not want to put their children in settings they believe harmful, and
customary routines of care are supported by the ethnotheories
shared by various caretakers. Second, the child and the niche are
subject to constant mutual influence and adaptation. The child, at
the center of the niche, has his or her own particular characteristics,

including sex, age, temperamental disposition, likes and dislikes,
and a range of abilities and disabilities; with those characteristics, the child elicits and creates a specific context. Similarly,
characteristics of the niche provide both opportunities and constraints to the child. A very active child, for example, may choose to
spend more time at the playground than a quiet one—but only if
such play spaces are available. Finally, all three elements of the
niche—settings, customs, and caretaker psychology—are in constant interaction with the larger culture. As new information,
technologies, or fashions are introduced through media, social
networks, and relevant professionals, the developmental niche will
evolve over time and generation.”

The concept of developmental niche can be used to delineate the
environment of a particular child at a particular developmental
stage.”” More powerfully for research purposes, aspects of the niche
commonly found in one community can be summarized and contrasted with those in another. Thus, we can compare the developmental niche for children of differing social class in the United
States with regard to their acquisition of mathematics,”' or, as we
will do here, compare the niches of infants in rural Kenya with
those of urban New England. The results provide a useful context

for understanding the behavior of infants and children, and the role
of culturally structured environments in shaping development.
THE DEVELOPMENTAL NICHE OF
INFANTS IN KOKWET
Kokwet is a farming community in western Kenya, about 200 miles
west of Nairobi, in the fertile, rolling hills where the western highlands slope down toward the Mara savannah lands. The 54 homesteads of Kokwet (a pseudonym) are spread out over about 6 square
miles, each cluster of grass- or tin-roofed houses surrounded by
pastures and fields. At the time of this research (1972-1975), the
typical household consisted of a husband and wife and about five
children; in one-quarter of the homesteads a second wife and her
children formed a second household. The people of Kokwet are
Kipsigis, a highland Nilotic people numbering about half a million.” Their traditional life at the beginning of the twentieth century was seminomadic; its economic base was pastoral, with some
simple agriculture. More permanent residence and land tenure
became common as a result of increasing contact with British settlers, missionaries, and colonial administrators.”

A newborn in Kokwet leaves the mother’s womb and enters a
world of women. The process of birth is attended by other women,
typically two or three relatives or neighbors. On rare occasions of
distress (perhaps 1% of births) senior men may be called in to “blow
into the mother’s mouth to push the baby out,” as one senior
woman explained. Also rarely (about 3 cases per 100), but salient to
the residents of Kokwet, a mother would fail to reach home as she
rushed from her garden fields, or would be waiting in desperation
for transportation to the missionary hospital, when the time for
birth arrived, and whoever was around, women or men, would
lend assistance.

More typically, new life in Kokwet arrives in the semidarkness
of the mother’s hut, and the neonate will stay there for at least 1
week with the mother, visited only by close neighbor women and
female relatives. After 7 days, more women visit with gifts of water
or milk. At 1 month, women bring maize, flour, and firewood. At 3
months, when the baby is no longer referred to as a chereret (monkey), the women bring milk and honey, sometimes as part of a
larger greeting ceremony, reminiscent of an older tradition that
includes beer and instruction by the father’s mother in the ways of
the clan. At this point, the mother resumes all her farm work and
begins to carry the baby on her back.

STATUS OF THE NEWBORN IN KOKWET
Eighty infants were born during our residence in Kokwet. One of
us (CMS) was able to examine 32 of them on the fifth day after birth,
using the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS).™ (In the
other 48 cases, either we learned too late of the babies’ arrivals, we
were absent from the community on the necessary day, or the mothers declined to allow our presence.) Just over half of the women
had attended the prenatal clinic at a missionary hospital at least
once, and all but two of the pregnancies were described as having
been uneventful. All infants were born at home or (in two instances)
on one of the paths leading home from the fields. Eight of the deliveries were described by the mothers as difficult. The babies
appeared normal and in good health at the time of examination,
except one with a cleft palate, and three with symptoms of upper
respiratory infection. Other characteristics of the sample, including
gestational age as estimated by the method of Dubowitz, Dubowitz, and Goldberg,” are included in Table 8.1.

90 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

Because of the low level of light, ambient noise, presence of
the mother, lack of furniture, and patterns of newborn care, the
standard examination procedures were modified somewhat;
primarily, modifications consisted of underplaying the aversive
procedures—especially the incurvation, Moro, and defensive
reflexes—in deference to the mothers’ concern with their infants’
perceived fragility.*° Nevertheless, the exam was generally comparable to the standard procedure, and the results can be meaningfully summarized (Table 8.1) using the clusters developed by
Lester and colleagues.””?””)

Table 8.1 also includes results from two other samples for the
purpose of comparison. The first was constructed shortly after
the African fieldwork to provide a comparison group with minimal medication, and consists of 17 Euro-American infants from
middle- and upper middle-class families in metropolitan Boston.
Mothers were recruited through two obstetric practices offering
a modification of LeBoyer’s “low stress” approach to delivery.”*
Parents attended childbirth classes, and fathers were present at the
hospital delivery in all but one case. Seven births were without
any medication, six involved local anesthetic only, and in four
cases a mild sedative was used. All infants were in good health at
the time of examination (by CMS), which was carried out at home
on day 5 with the same modifications as used in Kokwet (darkened room, mother present, and so forth). The second comparison
group was drawn more recently (2001-2006) from suburbs and
small towns in central and eastern Connecticut, and represents a
broader range of parent income and education. Participants in this
second group were recruited through pediatric and obstetric practices and by the “snowball” method. Six infants were delivered by
cesarean section; 7 of the mothers who delivered vaginally received
both an epidural and an opiate analgesic (usually Stadol), 13
received only an epidural, and 9 delivered without any medication. All infants were in good health at the time of examination,
which again was carried out at home on day 5, by one of us (CMS)
in half the cases, or by one of two other trained examiners.
Statistical analysis indicates no effect of maternal medication on
newborn behavior within this group. Overall, the three samples
reported here are surprisingly similar in their physical status at
birth, and the biggest status difference indicated in Table 8.1 is the
greater parity of the African sample.

At the behavioral level, rank-order analysis of variance indicates
overall group differences for three of the seven clusters (see
Table 8.1). The largest difference concerns Orientation, on which

## Page 18

The Developmental Niche of the Newborn in Rural Kenya 91
the Boston infants performed exceptionally well, perhaps reflecting
their excellent health and unimpaired deliveries, whereas the
infants in Kokwet and Connecticut generally scored lower. The Kipsigis infants, in turn, have the highest scores on State Regulation.
Examination of the individual items contributing to this cluster
reveals that only Hand-to-Mouth varies significantly in its own
right, although Consolability and Self-Quieting contribute strongly
to the overall contrast.

Finally, it appears that the Kipsigis infants scored lower on the
Motor Performance cluster than the U.S. groups, but a closer examination of the individual items reveals a more complex picture.
There are no significant differences in the component items of Pullto-Sit, Activity, or Defensive Movements; only on Tonus and Motor
Maturity do the groups differ significantly. Like Keefer and colleagues,” we perceived a qualitative difference in the motor tone of
many Kipsigis infants, namely that the tone tested stronger but was
still flexible, without signs of hypertonicity. Toward the end of this
fieldwork, we conducted a joint examination with Keefer of one
Kipsigis infant, confirming the similarity in our qualitative judgments. Unlike Keefer’s research group, however, we had not
devised new scores; rather we had coded on motor tone and simply noted, when appropriate, the poor fit with the hypertonic criterion. Thus, when the present data are prepared for making the
summary clusters by folding this scale at the midpoint,” high (even
though not hypertonic) scores pull down the final cluster score,
making it appear as a less good performance. In contrast, the Motor
Maturity item is not changed for the Motor Performance cluster;
the Kokwet sample, in general, displayed more restricted and jerky
movements than the Boston sample (and to a lesser degree, than
the Connecticut sample), properly leading to a lower total on the
Motor Performance cluster. In summary, then, there are two significantly differing motor items, pointing in opposite directions: The
infants in Kokwet showed stronger muscle tone than either of the
U.S. samples but at the same time slightly less mature motor
movements.

ETHNOTHEORIES OF INFANT BEHAVIOR
These are the observations of an American researcher, trained by
the Brazelton group to elicit and attend to certain characteristics of
neonatal behavior. The newborn’s niche, however, is formed by the
mother’s ethnotheories, which guide her behavior and are shared
with other women in the community. What do Kipsigis mothers

## Page 19

92 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

see in their newborns’ behavior? What ideas about babies do they
share with each other as part of their culture, and how do these ethnotheories shape the developmental niche of their infants? We
approached this question by asking the mothers to judge the
association, or similarity, of key items on the NBAS. If a baby likes
to look at a face, for example, how likely is it that this baby will also
turn his head toward the sound of a voice? Will it be easy to soothe
such a baby when she is upset? Twenty-two of the 27 behavioral
items on the NBAS were included in this systematic pairing, and
the resulting matrix of similarities was subjected to multidimensional scaling, a mathematical procedure that organizes the items
spatially such that “similarity” is represented by physical proximity. This same procedure was carried out with several other groups,
including the Boston mothers, and a sample of NBAS-trained and
certified researchers. The results demonstrate that these three
groups, when thinking of the same behaviors, use different ideas,
or cognitive schema, to organize their judgments (C. M. Super,
PhD, and S. Harkness, PhD, unpublished data, 2008).

The Kipsigis mothers were especially attuned to motor integrity
and responsiveness (e.g., Defensive Movements), and these characteristics weighed heavily in their judgments of similarity. The
Boston mothers, in contrast, used an organizational scheme focused
on cognitive competence, as seen by them, for example, in Orientation and Habituation. The difference between the way the two
groups of mothers interpret newborn behavior is nicely illustrated
by the comment of one U.S. mother that her newborn son was very
“alert and attentive.” Asked to elaborate, she replied, “Well, I can
tell because he holds his head up, you know, with his neck straight.”
For her, the cognitive, attentional element in a controlled orienting
of the head was more salient than the underlying neuromuscular
skill. A Kipsigis mother would have built her interpretation around
the integrity and smoothness of the motor act.

The NBAS experts, in contrast to both groups of mothers, were
particularly sensitive to the Regulation of Arousal state, that is, for
example, Consolability and Alertness compared to Startles and
High Activity Level. No one familiar with the examination will be
surprised at this result, because assessing the infant’s state and
adjusting one’s own behavior accordingly is a central part of the
procedure and is emphasized in training.

The theme of motor integrity and responsiveness is woven
throughout Kipsigis ethnotheories of infant development in several ways. Initially, intact infants are calm, and although capable of
making known their needs for food and warmth, they are not prone

## Page 20

The Developmental Niche of the Newborn in Rural Kenya 93
to uncontrolled and unresponsive crying. Both symbolically and
protectively, quiet is good.** Too much excitement or arousal might
attract unwanted attention; and just as the condition of pregnancy
is virtually a taboo subject for discussion, in part to avoid the witchcraft of jealousy, so young infants are best kept calm and quiet.
More obviously, especially as the baby gains in strength and maturity, the successful accomplishment of motor milestones is taken as
evidence of robust development and competent mothering—a
promise of strong help in the fields and at home. A common greeting to a mother whom one has not seen for a period is, with obvious reference to the child on her back, “Tianna?” (’What has he or
she learned?”) and it is answered, “He is sitting now” or “She
walks.” When asked as part of a child-rearing interview, virtually
all mothers in Kokwet said they made an effort to teach their babies
to sit, stand, and walk. What would happen, they were asked
further, if a mother somewhere, for some reason, did not teach
these things? The common answer, after a moment to assimilate
such an outrageous idea, was that the child would not learn them.
The more thoughtful mothers suggested, “Perhaps they would
only learn these things later”; but for all of them, such a scenario
seemed bizarre.

CUSTOMS OF INFANT CARE

The customary care of newborns and infants in Kokwet directly
reflects these ethnotheories. From the first days of life, the stepping
reflex is exercised on the outstretched legs of the mother or grandmother sitting on the floor of the hut or, after a week, outside in the
sun on a cool day, or in the shade when the sunshine is too bright
and hot. This activity, called keguld6, is evidently an enjoyable way
to play with the baby, but in addition, the bouncing is thought of as
developing the muscles and skills for walking. The frequency of
keguld6 can be estimated by averaging over nearly 2,000 spot observations and quick interviews, which indicate the activity takes
place two or three times per week during the first month, increases
in frequency to nearly every day at 4 and 5 months, and then
decreases only as a more directed “teaching to walk” (kitwalse) is
begun around 6 months (C. M. Super, PhD, and S. Harkness, PhD,
unpublished data, 2008).

There are other customs that stimulate or support motor development but are not particularly carried out for that purpose. During
the newborn period, for example, most babies are massaged twice
a day with butter or Vaseline; this is to keep the skin from drying

## Page 21

94. CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
and to help the baby sleep. When awake, the baby is being held
nearly 80% of the time, usually in the arms or lap. Although these
positions do not provide as much muscle stimulation as the traditional back-carrying (which does not become common until around
4 months), they do nevertheless require more postural adjustment
on the baby’s part than lying down, the predominant position
(59%) for infants in the U.S. sample (C. M. Super, PhD, and S. Harkness, PhD, unpublished data, 2008).

SETTINGS OF INFANT LIFE
Many of the customs that are not specifically oriented toward
strengthening motor development, but are nevertheless supportive of it, follow naturally from the physical and social settings of
newborn life in Kokwet. The one-room hut, which serves as birthing room, kitchen, dining room, and family room, is typically made
in the mud-and-wattle style: wooden posts placed in a circle with
saplings woven around them to form walls, and topped with a
thatched conical roof. The walls and contoured floor are coated
with mud mixed with cow dung, which dries to a smooth hard
surface. A recessed fire pit usually lies toward one side, and slightly
raised areas for bedding on another. Furniture is minimal, with a
small cupboard, perhaps a table and a few chairs. The space is relatively warm and cozy (and smoky) during the cold wet season, and
cool and dark when it is hot outside. It is not, however, a safe place
for infants to be on the floor, or even unattended in the sleeping
area. On the other hand, there are usually several people around—
the mother, grandmother, preadolescent siblings, and perhaps
neighbor women or other visitors. There is always a lap or pair of
arms to keep the baby safe and warm and not “alone.”

CONCLUSION

The setting and customs that surround the opening weeks of
life work systematically with local ethnotheories to promote optimal development as it is conceived by the mothers of Kokwet.
These cultural factors are in play at birth, and an examination
5 days after birth probably reflects some effect of their shaping of
behavior. The behavioral differences are subtle in that healthy
babies are seen to be so similar in these culturally divergent samples. The small but specific differences in NBAS scores demonstrated here are consonant with the respective developmental
niches. The Boston sample, in the best health and delivered without

## Page 22

medication, showed the best performance on Orientation. The
infants in Kokwet demonstrated a modest advance in State Regulation, which probably reflects their relatively subdued environment
and treatment (even during the exam). Finally, we can reasonably
speculate that the daily massages and frequent elicitation of walking and stepping reflexes in Kokwet, starting from the first day of
life, resulted in superior motor tone on day 5.

Given the prominence of motor performance in the Kipsigis
mothers’ ethnotheories of infant development, and its facilitation
through the settings and customs of care, it is not surprising that
the Kokwet infants (and many other traditionally reared infants in
Africa) reach many of the motor milestones earlier than is typically
true in the United States, in particular the various markers of
advanced sitting and walking.?!?*3* Ironically, but understandably, the mothers of Kokwet are not aware of this difference, and
most believe that “European” (White) children walk earlier than
their own. For one thing, they point out, Europeans live in towns,
where it is easier to get to a doctor if you need one. Also, European
mothers don’t work in the fields and stay home more, the Kipsigis
women say; hence European mothers are never delayed by work in
feeding the child, and they have more time to teach their babies to
walk, as any good mother would.

The women of Kokwet are correct in imagining that cultural
groups shape their infants’ development from the earliest days,
even if they lack comparative data to specify and evaluate the differences. As developmental science continues to incorporate the
perspectives and tools of multiple disciplines, including anthropology as well as developmental pediatrics, we can all come to see
more clearly that newborns, like other persons, live and grow in a
cultural environment.

CHAPTER 9
Early Intervention
and Fatherhood:
Denmark
HANNE MUNCK
In 1975, at the University of Copenhagen, we started using the
Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) in teaching and
research. The NBAS,! and from 1982 the Assessment of Preterm
Infants’ Behavior (APIB)* helped us demonstrate the capacities and
individuality of newborns and prematurely born infants. These
scales have played a role in modernizing hospital routines and
practice.**° In 1989, after more than 15 years of research and clinical work with the families of newborns, we established the center
for Infants and Their Families under the leadership of the author at
the Institute of Psychology in Copenhagen. The work at the center
is cross-disciplinary, with two psychologists, a social worker, a
relaxation therapist, a specially trained educationist, and eight students of psychology. Being a university clinic, the center is engaged
in graduate, as well as postgraduate, training in early intervention
and infant observation. From its beginning, the center worked in
close and intense collaboration with six public health nurses from
the local district. During the infants’ first years, the nurses pay regular home visits to all new families in the district, regardless of
need. The visits are part of the public preventive health-care system and are received by almost every family in Denmark, irrespective of social status.° The nurses advise each family on everything
concerning their infant’s health and development. The number of
visits depends on the family’s particular situation.
A great many research studies have been undertaken by the center,
most recently focusing on fathers and their relation to their infants.
101

## Page 30

102 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

The three functions of the center—running a clinic for treatment
of families, educating students, and doing research (often in collaboration with institutions outside the university clinic)—are closely
integrated into daily working routines.

This chapter draws on clinical therapeutic experiences as well as
results from some of our studies at the center. We discuss three topics: (1) the advantages of a primary prophylactic approach compared with focusing on traditional risk groups, (2) the growing
focus on fathers, and (3) the advantages of infant observation as an
integrated aspect of early intervention and as part of the therapeutic training of the young clinician.

FAMILIES AND THEIR NEEDS

In order to explore the kind and amount of problems in families
during the first year of their infants’ lives, we conducted a demographic study of all infants born in a particular year—1990—in our
local district.’ This area of Copenhagen has a population of 45,000,
with approximately 400 births per annum. In 1990, the number of
newborns was 389. The study was carried out retrospectively, two
years after the infants’ births, to make possible the comparison of
situations for referred families with those of families not in need of
referral. The six public health nurses in the district filled out an
extensive questionnaire based on their records of the 389 families
with newborns. The families were divided into four groups according to the number, character, and seriousness of their problems.
The amount of difficulty they experienced must be considered in
context: These families live in a welfare society with a high social,
economic, and educational level and a paid, 12-month maternity
leave for the mother (the last half taken either by the mother or by
the father) and a 2-week leave for the father right after the delivery
of the infant. Also, the rate of wanted and planned pregnancies in
Denmark is extremely high because there is free access to abortion.
The four groups were:

Group A: This group consisted of families who fit the standard
visiting profile. (In 1990, the recommended number of visits
to a family without problems was seven in the first year of the
infant’s life.) These families were described by the nurses as
having infants who were developing well and parents who
demonstrated good parenting skills without any need for
further assistance. The number of families in this group was
166 (44.7%).

## Page 31

Early Intervention and Fatherhood: Denmark 103

Group B: These families had minor problems of a moderate and
well-defined nature, suchas breastfeeding difficulties, weight/
diet problems, and/or mild parental insecurity. There was a
need for an extra effort (extra visits, telephone calls) by the
nurse, but there was no reason for concern about the future
development of the family or the infant. The number of families in this group was 141(34.2%).

Group C: This group consisted of a small group of families who
had greater problems and needed more intensive intervention. There might have been several factors (physical, psychological, social) jeopardizing the family situation. The nurses
described their main task as motivating these families to
accept further help, without which the development of the
infant would be imminently at risk. The number of families in
this group was 57(14.7%).

Group D: This group was made up of an even smaller group of
families, who had very serious and complex problems, such as
alcohol or drug abuse, domestic violence, child maltreatment
or neglect, or serious emotional problems. These families, and
especially the development of their infants, were endangered.
The efforts of the nurses alone would never be sufficient. The
number of families in this group was 25 (6.4%).

EARLY PROPHYLACTIC APPROACH AND
THE CONCEPT OF RISK GROUP
Somewhat surprisingly, we found that a great proportion of families that traditionally would be considered at risk were doing quite
well without any professional help other than that offered to all
families by the public health nurses. This was the case for almost
two-thirds of those parents (all mothers) who were living alone
with their infants; the extra help to those who needed it in this
group consisted, for the most part, of more visits from the nurse.
This does not mean it is easy to be a single parent, but it does
show that these mothers could cope with their social and psychological situation and were able to give their infants what was
required for their healthy development and overall well-being.

Another group traditionally considered to be at high risk were

families with prematurely born infants. In cooperation with the
neonatal intensive care unit at the University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, we carried out two extensive follow-up projects with
very premature children (those with birthweights below 1,500g)
and extremely premature children (those with birthweights

## Page 32

104 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

below 1,000g). Each group comprised about 400 families, which
were examined when the children were 4 and 5 years old.*? We
found that, as a group, parents of both groups were well-functioning
in their relationships with their children; we assessed their relationships with respect to sensitivity, appreciation, and loving attention.®
These results contradict the often-made argument that the strain
put on families with very low birthweight infants renders the parents less able to react in a sensitive manner later in their children’s
lives. Despite the strain of giving birth very prematurely, and in
spite of the stress caused by prolonged hospitalization of the newborn infant, the parents of both groups of prematurely born children
in our studies were just as sensitive as the control parents. We think
that these results are explained partly by the fact that in Denmark
there is no significant connection between preterm delivery and
a typical socioeconomic profile of poor living conditions (as is the
case in the United States and the United Kingdom) and partly as a
result of the tremendous change that had already taken place in
Denmark and comparable countries with respect to the parents’
active participation in the care of their infants in the neonatal intensive care units. !°

Negative social history, combined with massive problems
involving alcohol, violence, and child abuse, are well-known risk
factors to infants’ development in young families, and this was the
case for the 6.4% in our study who were referred to various social
agencies—half of them also to our center. A great many of these
families were the second generation or more with massive difficulties. But apart from these obviously troubled families, the public
health nurses found that about 10% of the 389 families had a private
social network that was lacking, inadequate, or strained in much
more subtle and discrete ways. In fact, their situations were so burdening to these families that the functioning of the parents was
influenced to a worrying degree. Only through personal and frequent contact did the nurses learn about these problems (which
otherwise might easily have been overlooked) and help the family
further by paying them extra visits or making appropriate referrals. The quality of the families’ private social network was the single most significant factor distinguishing referred families from
families not referred to our center.

There are two important dangers in focusing too much on risk
groups: one is that of overlooking difficulties in families that do
not belong to the traditionally defined risk groups; the other is that
of stigmatizing and having expectations that are too negative

based solely on the basis of well and easily defined outward
circumstances.

FATHERS AND THEIR INFANTS

There is a common complaint among health-care professionals that
in the growing area of early intervention, the focus on fathers is
rather sparse, with most offers of intervention (and most research
interest) given to the mother-infant relationship.'’’? At our center,
we always suggest that both parents participate in treatment.
Analyzing the families who were referred to our center in the first
three years of the center’s existence, we found that in 67% of our
two-parent families, the fathers participated in our treatment.
However, the public health nurses mentioned fathers’ problems as
the reason for referrals in only 7% of the cases, and only in combination with mothers’ problems (which were mentioned in more
than 80% of the cases) or in combination with the infants’ problems
(mentioned in 39% of the referrals). Nevertheless, in the course of
the ensuing therapeutic process, we estimated that 25% of the
participating fathers exhibited problems that required treatment.
We discovered that fathers’ psychological problems are easily overlooked, even if the fathers are in contact with the primary healthcare system: In 80% of all families, the fathers had participated in
the visits from the public health nurses.’

Our clinical work with both parents led to an increased interest
in fatherhood and in fathers’ relationships with their infants. So for
the past 5 years, we have conducted a series of studies on fathers
in cooperation with the University Hospital of Copenhagen,
Rigshospitalet. The main study consisted of extensive interviews
with 42 fathers 4 weeks before delivery, 2 weeks after the birth of
their infants, and again when the infants were 5 months old. The
fathers were asked about their expectations, feelings, and reflections on their fatherhood, their relationships to their own parents,
and their relations with their infants. Other studies concentrated
on their expectations, thoughts, wishes, fears, and actual experiences around the delivery.

Results from our studies show that 77% of fathers interviewed
during pregnancy spontaneously talked about how worried, anxious, and troubled they felt. They were concerned about their
infants’ well-being, the delivery, their own capacities for parenting,
and whether they would have enough time for their children as
well as for themselves. Five months after delivery, 60% of the

## Page 34

106 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

fathers in their first, spontaneous statements were eager to talk
about joy, love, pleasure, and delight in being fathers. There was an
interesting difference between the fathers’ representations of their
infants as time went on. Before delivery, 65% of the fathers’ representations of their expected infants referred to an older child (and
not to an infant). But 5 months after delivery, 85% of the fathers
talked only about imaginings and representations of an infant; and
54% of the fathers’ descriptions demonstrated sensitivity—the ability to identify with the infant’s life, feelings, and experiences of his
or her world."

From our studies using questionnaires, we found that 75% of the
fathers participated in the prophylactic consultations during
pregnancy. Almost all of them found it beneficial. Two-thirds of the
fathers felt personally welcome, but 54% did not feel directly
invited, and 40% did not experience being directly addressed by
the midwives during the consultations. Ninety-seven percent of
Danish fathers are present at the delivery of their babies. In one
study, 165 fathers completed questionnaires, both before and after
delivery, about their expectations and experiences. They stated that
they wanted to be present not only to support their partners, but
for their own sakes; they appreciated having been there (98%) and
felt they had played an important role.'*’>°

Our findings showed a strong involvement on the part of the
fathers during pregnancy and delivery, but, at the same time, an
apparent discrepancy between the attitude of the official health
authorities (the Danish Health Board) and the families, concerning
the father’s role and the importance of his participation in the birth
of his child.

The Danish Health Board hardly mentions the father in their
publications and general directives. Likewise, in contrast to the
wishes of both fathers and mothers, traditional hospital routines
do not allow the father to stay overnight at the hospital with the
mother and the newborn infant after delivery.

Such a policy indirectly supports a view of fathers’ presence
as being of little importance, ignoring the significance of the
fathers’ involvement, which is clearly shown in our study and is
currently being confirmed by experiences from our therapeutic
intervention.

Attitudes seem to have been changing, following a period of
much public discussion. Several Danish hospitals now offer fathers
the opportunity to stay the first night after delivery. And in January
2004, a large Copenhagen hospital, Hvidovre, announced that
it would be the first in Denmark to allow the father to stay overnight

EARLY INTERVENTION AND THE IMPORTANCE

OF INFANT OBSERVATION

At the Center for Infants and Their Families, we see families very
early; more than 60% are referred before the infant reaches 3 months
of age. Most often, we have mother, father, and infant together in
our therapeutic sessions. Because the majority of Danish women
breastfeed their infants (more than 60% for more than 6 months), it
is convenient for the mothers to bring their infants; and having the
infant in the therapy sessions is of tremendous value. We see, as did
Selma Fraiberg in 1980, that the infant acts as a catalyst for change
and in most cases intensifies the therapeutic process.’” As argued
previously, we also see it as a pronounced advantage, in most cases,
to have the father participate in the intervention, as well.

Even if it is the mother who seems in greater need of help, who
shows signs of depression or ambivalence, or who expresses feelings of serious inadequacy, it is our experience that the dynamic
between the parents plays a greater role in the whole family’s
functioning than is usually considered. Even if the father has no
psychological problems himself, other than worry for his wife, we

## Page 37

108 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

find that the father’s presence and the participation of the intact
family provides a better outcome and leads to more permanent
changes and stability. Perhaps this finding is connected with the
previously mentioned sharing of responsibilities and the equality
of involvement of Danish parents in coping with daily life. We still
need a more structured assessment to test this impression of a better outcome. However, we share with the public health nurses who
continue to follow the families the point of view that the fathers’
participation in therapy is beneficial.

In our interventional treatment models, we mainly use two tools.
One is observation (of infants and of parent-infant interaction);
the other is traditional psychodynamic psychotherapy (focused
on the parents individually or as a couple). We usually work with
an integration of these approaches. Combining our skills in observation and psychotherapy, we can follow each family in its individuality; and we are able to shift focus flexibly, according to the needs
encountered.!®

This integrated approach offers special opportunities and at the
same time makes special demands on the therapist. When dealing
with families with small infants, it is easy to be overwhelmed by all
the input, and difficult to witness the pain and suffering stemming
from unhappy and unsatisfying interactions. The urge to act, to do
something, to try to make the situation better at once, is common,
especially among our young therapists. In the sessions, however, it
is important to keep our balance in observing without necessarily
intervening, to concentrate on what the parents say and feel without overlooking what they actually do and how the baby is doing.
In order to keep this balance, we find it necessary for the therapist
to have both therapeutic training and elaborate skills in observing
infants. The therapist’s patient, observant, nonjudgmental position
is crucial; and therefore, such concepts as containing, holding,
reflecting, and timing are at the core of our training. Our training
models consist of training in infant observation, and training in
psychotherapy under supervision; we use co-therapeutic models,
one-way screen observations, and video recordings.

Questions That Guide Our Work
e What do we see? Seeing and observing play a crucial role. The
obstacles against being able to see are numerous and complex.
Why was the infant not seen as an individual in the professional
world for so long? Preconceived knowledge and theory did
not allow the space or expectation for being attentive. Perhaps

## Page 38

Early Intervention and Fatherhood: Denmark 109
also there is a feeling in primary health care of powerlessness,
of not knowing what to do. (The public health nurses report
that after they began working with our center they also began
to dare to see more difficulties. They allowed themselves to
acknowledge the problems they saw because now they could
do something to help: They could tell us about a family’s situation and receive appropriate guidance, or they could give the
family a referral to our center for further treatment.)

e What do we feel? Contact with a troubled family arouses many
feelings. It is urgent to be attentive to these feelings and not
just to suppress them—to allow them to be there and, within
the context of the supervision process, to clarify them. It is
essential to resonate and to contain the pain, anger, fear, sadness (and, more seldom, joy) stemming from the family.

e What do we understand? How do we understand the situation
of a family? Why are they doing the things they do in their
lives and in the sessions? In this work, we need to be able to
stay with and endure a position of not-knowing and doubt for
quite a while.

e How do we describe? We try to be aware of the ways and the
words we use to describe. We find tremendous advantages in
using plain, normal, common words in our descriptions of
concrete activities and in quoting the words used by the parents as accurately as possible. We defer the use of the more
interpretive and diagnostic terms for theoretical discussions.

e What do we do? What do we want to do? What does the
family want us to do? What does the family allow us to do?
What are the possibilities? Changes occur only through the
family’s own activity. Are our expectations realistic? Do our
interventions have any side effects? Or, rather, what will the
side effects of our interventions be?

These are the questions we often put to ourselves when working

in this sensitive area.

CONCLUSION
So far, our studies in fatherhood indicate that the inner turmoil and
external adaptations of new fathers put them in a psychological
state very much like that of new mothers (described by Daniel
Stern as the “Motherhood Constellation”)! and that the transition
to fatherhood is a unique psychological constellation that contains

## Page 39

110 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
not only energy and capacities to attach and attune to an infant but
also vulnerability.

The rather new, but so far very promising, approach to involve
fathers in early intervention will undoubtedly be more developed
in the near future. As this happens, our knowledge about fathers,
and therefore our capacity to help families, will improve.

We believe that giving more attention in theory, research, and
clinical practice to fathers, their experiences with their infants,
and their transition to fatherhood is a necessity for development of
the capacities embodied in fatherhood; and we hope, with our
work, to facilitate and contribute to this development.

CHAPTER 10
A Model for Working in
Community Health Settings:
United Kingdom
JOANNA HAWTHORNE anp BETTY HUTCHON

Recently in the United Kingdom, the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) has become popular with health professionals
as a supportive intervention for parents of all newborns—especially
when newborns are preterm or have developmental issues, or
when parents have concerns or there are relationship difficulties. It
helps parents come to terms with their babies, validates their observations of their young infants, and strengthens relationships
between health professionals and families. With funding from
the government’s early intervention project, Sure Start, several
community-based teams in deprived areas are being trained in
using the NBAS as a supportive intervention.

When using the NBAS in a community setting, the goals are
similar to those in a hospital setting, namely:

e To sensitize parents to their newborn’s capacities

¢ To describe positive behavior as well as difficult behavior

¢ To help parents read their infant’s behavioral cues as mean
ingful communication

At present, the NBAS is not widely available in either hospital or
community settings in the United Kingdom, although 164 people
are fully trained, and 100 are in the process of training, particularly
Sure Start, UK, and Flying Start, Wales, personnel. These are healthcare workers whose brief is health promotion and education and,
above all, providing support for mothers in deprived areas, to
enable them to develop healthy relationships with their infants.
112

## Page 42

A Model for Working in Community Health Settings 113

In this chapter, we describe the use of the NBAS with preterm
babies in a neonatal unit and on follow-up in the community, and
illustrate with two examples from the community, one using the
NBAS with a full-term baby, and the other using the NBAS with a
baby who has Prader Willi syndrome.

GOING HOME FROM THE NEONATAL

UNIT—CAMBRIDGE SURVEY
Parents who have a sick or premature baby can take time adjusting
to the baby they have. The baby in the incubator may be very different from the baby they envisaged throughout pregnancy. The
mother’s pregnancy may have been cut short by a premature birth,
and her baby may not look like the chubby full-term baby she and
her partner imagined.

Parents can have difficulties getting to know their baby in the
public atmosphere of the neonatal unit, and if the baby is very ill,
access can be hampered by tubes and monitors. The baby may also
be very fragile and sensitive to touch, so often parents cannot stroke
and hold their baby as much as they would like because doing so
could be overstimulating for the baby.

Once the baby is 36 weeks gestation, medically stable, and almost
ready to go home, the NBAS can be used as a preventive intervention. It can demonstrate to parents their baby’s skills and help them
read their baby’s signals and cues. It can guide parents in learning to
figure out ways to help their baby be comfortable and self-regulated.

Several studies have shown that parents need increased support
when they have a premature baby. Counseling is available in several U.K. neonatal units, and a few units have multidisciplinary
teams—including, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech
therapists nutritionists, and psychologists—that care for all aspects
of the premature babies’ development. In a few units in the United
Kingdom, nurses use the Neonatal Individualized Developmental
Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP). Some units use the Neonatal Assessment for Premature Infants (NAPI), and a few use
the NBAS.

In Cambridge, England, the Community Neonatal Nursing team
was established at Addenbrookes Hospital in 2002 to provide
medical and feeding support at home. It was decided to set up a
supportive intervention using the NBAS. The aim was to provide
an intervention to support parents whose babies sometimes had to
wait for some time between discharge from the neonatal unit
and their first appointment with the Child Development Center.

114 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

Once the intervention was concluded, 22 families were surveyed by
a postal questionnaire, which asked them about the intervention.
Protocol for Intervention Using the NBAS

¢ Weekly visits to parents in the NICU observing, discussing,

and sharing baby behavior

e First NBAS: baby over 35 weeks gestation and medically

stable

e Second and third NBAS exams: 2 and 4 weeks after discharge

home

e Postal questionnaire: 2 weeks after last NBAS
BRAZELTON CONCEPTS
Over the course of the baby’s time in the NICU and Special Care
Baby Unit (SCBU), the psychologist discusses the following points
with the parents as they sit beside the baby and all observe the baby
together:

1. What is your baby like? How would you describe his or her

personality?

2. What does your baby like to do/look at?

3. How does your baby react to noise and light?

4. How does your baby react to handling?

5. What position does your baby like to be in?

6. How does your baby manage his or her sleep and awake

states?

7. How does your baby comfort him- or herself?

8. Is your baby cuddly?

9. Is your baby strong?

10. How does your baby show you he or she knows you?

Of the 22 families surveyed in the follow-up study, 14 mothers
responded. Of these, almost half (46%) reported that the NBAS
helped them notice something about their babies they had not
noticed before. Most mothers (64%) felt the sessions had helped
them adjust to their baby’s behavior, and 57% felt that their babies
had benefited from the NBAS. Sixty-two percent of the mothers felt
that their needs and their babies’ needs for emotional support were
being met. All the parents who responded to the survey said that
they found the NBAS helpful and would recommend it to other
parents.

## Page 44

A Model for Working in Community Health Settings 115

Many parents wrote comments about the intervention express
ing their thoughts:

¢ “Bonding is difficult in the NICU. The baby does not feel like
your own. The assessment helps to affirm you do know your
baby.”

e “Gave us the ability to see him as a ‘normal’ developing baby
and not seem like a medical patient.”

e “Sessions helped us relax and enjoy time spent with him
rather than anticipating the worst.”

e “Hadn't previously realized how much it was possible to
interact with her and therefore played with her much more
following sessions.”

e “Amazing to me to see someone being so positive about my
baby who was so sick.”

e “T do now spend longer watching her and adapt my behavior
depending on hers.”

The staff reported that they felt the parents were more confident,

less hostile, and more accepting of their baby’s situation.

UsING THE NBAS At HOME

Babies from the NICU and SCBU are more likely to have challenging behaviors compared to full-term babies, and the NBAS can help
parents understand their baby’s signals and cues and work out
strategies to support their babies’ development. Performing the
NBAS twice in each home gave parents a chance to discuss their
baby’s behavior first in relation to the baby’s homecoming, and
later in terms of the concerns that developed once the family had
been at home for a while. The NBAS intervention offered nonmedical support that bolstered parental efforts to regain control over
the care of their baby after a long stay in the neonatal unit, where the
parents may have felt de-skilled. The community neonatal nurses
continued to visit the family until feeding was well-established.

Interventions in the early weeks have been shown to be effective

in supporting the developing parent-baby relationship. Early interventions have also been shown to improve collaboration between
parents and the hospital staff and among members of staff. Using
the NBAS in the NICU/SCBU has continued to take place in the
hospital in Cambridge. A community neonatal nurse, midwives,
and health visitors are training in the NBAS, and the neonatologists are keen to support this work.

116 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
The following examples illustrate the use of the NBAS in supporting parents and their efforts to understand their baby’s
behavior.
Clinical Examples
Baby A
Baby A’s birth had been a planned home birth, but due to complications, his mother was transferred to the hospital labor ward. Following
delivery, the infant was transferred to the SCBU. He was a full-term
newborn, but not the healthy baby his parents had anticipated. He was
very sleepy, had problems feeding, and had low muscle tone. The medical staff broke the news to his parents that it was very likely that Baby A
had something the parents had probably never heard of—Prader Willi
syndrome. The parents were distraught. The occupational therapist initially approached the parents while in SCBU but, feeling that they were
still coming to grips with the diagnosis, decided that a follow-up visit
on discharge at home would be more beneficial.

The occupational therapist administered the first NBAS in Baby A’s
home when he was one week postterm. His parents’ primary concern,
at this point, was his poor feeding; and he continued to be fed mainly
through a nasogastric tube. His mother had planned on breastfeeding
and was still keen to pursue this goal.

Throughout the administration of the NBAS, the parents watched
intently. Baby A remained mostly in States 2 and 3. He showed no fussing or irritability in response to any of the maneuvers or stimuli. His
muscle tone was low, and his reflexes were weak—in particular, the suck
reflex. During the Orientation items, he showed an emerging State 4 and
tried desperately to fix and follow. His parents were very excited by this.
They said it was the first time they had seen him respond in this way.

Upon completing the NBAS, the occupational therapist sat with the
parents and explained in more detail how the behaviors observed during its administration could now be used to help plan some short-term
goals. Discussion focused largely on the range of states available to a
strong newborn and how Baby A, while not showing the full six states
at this stage, could be helped to achieve them. The occupational therapist provided ideas and suggestions regarding appropriate stimulation
to help promote a wider range of states and, in particular, State 4. The
parents were very encouraged by this discussion and were able to make
the association between more alert, robust states and better feeding. It
also gave them hope that they could help their baby play and learn.
They were glad to have the structure of the NBAS in order to see and
understand their child’s strengths, as well as his vulnerabilities.

Baby A’s parents commented that it was their first positive experience since their child’s birth. They were a well-educated, articulate

couple, and they appreciated the systematic approach of the NBAS. It
helped provide goals and gave them some positive ideas for things they
could do with their baby to help promote his development.

The occupational therapist continued weekly home visits to Baby A
throughout his first few months and administered the NBAS on several
more occasions. His parents continued to find it the most positive experience of any other intervention. They established a close and trusting
relationship with the therapist and continue to send Christmas cards
from Baby A, who is now 7 years old.

Baby B

Baby B was referred to the occupational therapist by the Health Visitor
(public health nurse) who specifically requested that the NBAS be
administered. The Health Visitor had heard of the NBAS at a professional seminar and had been particularly impressed by a case study that
illustrated its use with irritable babies. Baby B was described as one of
twins who were born at term and who were now 7 weeks old. The difficulty with Baby B was that he kept crying despite much comforting and
consoling, and his mother was finding it increasingly difficult to cope.
There appeared to be no reason for the persistent crying. His twin sister
was described as doing well, and there were no reported concerns about
any aspect of her development.

The occupational therapist visited the family with the Health Visitor
the day after the referral. The mother was very pleased because the
nurse had explained previously that the therapist had a technique that
could be very helpful in identifying the source of a baby’s irritability.
The occupational therapist felt slightly anxious about this introduction,
wotried that the mother might feel badly let down if these expectations
were not met.

Baby B was asleep in his seat in the living room. The occupational
therapist, after giving the mother some information about the NBAS
and what might happen, proceeded to administer the Habituation
items. Baby B responded to these items with classic “textbook” habituation: he initially responded to the items while asleep, but was able to
decrease and eventually cut out his responses after several administrations. He continued to sleep soundly in his chair, and showed no sign of
irritability.

The therapist followed the Habituation items by gently picking up
Baby B, undressing him a little, placing him on his changing mat, and
administering the Reflex items. These items normally help to wake a
sleeping baby, but Baby B continued to sleep and had to be helped to
wake up. At this point, Baby B had already demonstrated robust States
1, 2, and 3; but now went immediately to a State 6—the crying state.
Baby B’s mother explained this was typical behavior whenever he was
awake. She described him as only sleeping and crying. Baby B made

some serious efforts to comfort himself but didn’t succeed in bringing
himself to a quieter state. Neither did any of the consoling maneuvers
result in a State 4. Baby B’s mother said she would often have to leave
him in this crying state because he wouldn’t stop and eventually he
would wear himself out and fall asleep again. The occupational therapist attempted to get Baby B interested in the Orientation items by talking to him and playing with the rattle. Baby B settled down momentarily and showed wide-eyed State 4 interest in the rattle but quickly
became upset again and looked away. Once or twice more it was possible to get some purposeful fixing and following and an alert State 4; but
Baby B seemed to be unable to sustain it, instead protesting loudly and
again going to a State 6.

A lengthy discussion followed, involving the mother, the Health
Visitor, and the occupational therapist. The NBAS had shown a profile
of a baby who had a full range of strong robust states. He did not show
any hypersensitivities to the environment, nor to the items presented. It
seemed clear he was communicating another need, which the therapist
felt might be hunger. However, the mother and the Health Visitor disagreed, explaining that because he was a twin, Baby B was being fed
every four hours (this schedule was felt to be more manageable for his
mother); and he was putting on weight appropriately and progressing
up his weight chart.

The occupational therapist felt that further investigation of his crying
might be helpful because both Baby B and his mother were distressed.
Baby B’s mother was anxious to be given ideas about responding to her
baby in ways that would be helpful, but because demand feeding did
not seem to be an option, the therapist suggested she visit her general
practitioner for further advice.

The occupational therapist arranged a follow-up visit to the home in
2 weeks time. On this second occasion, a very different Baby B was
found. He was happy, playful, and alert. The therapist was surprised
and asked the mother what had changed. The mother explained that
following the administration of the NBAS, which had ruled out any
hypersensitivities being the source of the crying, she reconsidered the
program of feeding Baby B every 4 hours and decided to feed him
whenever he cried. He immediately became quieter, happier, and more
content; and she now had a baby who was happy to be awake and play.
The occupational therapist and the mother discussed the fact that babies
are not aware of weight charts, and some babies just like to feed more
than others. The mother was very grateful that the NBAS had facilitated
a systematic assessment of her baby, and while it was not able to pinpoint definitely that his protest was about food, it was able to rule out
other possibilities. This insight, provided by the NBAS, appears to have
helped the mother gain confidence in understanding her baby and
inspired her to try another approach to feeding.

CONCLUSION

These examples show how the NBAS can provide a supportive

intervention to parents of premature babies, parents of babies with

different syndromes, and parents with babies who may be difficult
to read. There is an advantage in providing community follow-up,
as parents tend to be more comfortable in their own homes than in
the hospital, and as they spend more time with their babies, they
can feel more in charge. Support in the community also allows the
health professional to see the parent for a more extended followup. The Health Service in the United Kingdom is structured to
allow for support in the community, and the NBAS is gradually
becoming a vital component of its early intervention strategy.

Eric was born at 24 weeks of gestation weighing 620 g. He suffered a

severe brain hemorrhage (grade IV) soon after birth and has been diag
nosed with Stage 2 retinopathy of prematurity. Finally home after 4 long

months in the hospital, he is off oxygen during the day but still requires

it at night. He is bottle-fed but tires easily and can only take up to

2 ounces per feeding. His neonatal intensive care unit discharge nurse

referred him to early intervention (EI). After he was home 1 week, Eric’s

mother received a phone call from the EI program coordinator and

scheduled a convenient time for his initial eligibility evaluation.
When an infant is referred to EI, the first point of contact between
the family and the EI service providers is often in the context of the
initial eligibility evaluation. As those involved in this process know,
completing a developmental assessment and service plan on sucha
young and medically fragile infant is no small task. Interventionists often leave an initial eligibility evaluation session feeling that
they have missed valuable information and have not been as
helpful to parents as they would like to have been. On the other

hand, parents may not have received the kind of developmental
information and support they need in the early weeks and months
following homecoming. The clinician’s ability to establish a relationship of support with the family seems compromised from the
beginning. While there are many possible reasons to explain why
both parties feel their needs are not met, two of the main reasons
are: (1) a lack of evaluation instruments designed to capture the
early signs of developmental competencies and vulnerabilities in
the very young infant, and (2) a need for specialized training in very
early infant development and neurobehavioral functioning for EI
providers.

To support the efforts of EI service providers in determining
eligibility and subsequent individual developmental goals of
infants and families, the developmental assessment of a very young
infant should accomplish three major goals:'

1. Determine the level of developmental maturity.

2. Identify the areas of developmental vulnerabilities.

3. Offer guidance to families for immediate individualized

developmental intervention.

In order to reach these goals, the assessment model used for the
very young and sensitive infant should be designed to examine
the level of competency of very early developmental skills and
be able to identify immediate and individualized intervention
strategies for infants and their families. This chapter provides an
overview of the evaluation process in EI and describes how the
integration of the Newborn Behavioral Observations (NBO) system
into the eligibility evaluation will assist EI providers in conducting
improved assessment and program planning for young infants
while meeting the needs of families for individualized attention
and services.’

MEETING THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES OF VERY
YOUNG INFANTS IN EARLY INTERVENTION
The mission of most EI programs is to strengthen the capacity of
families to meet the developmental needs of their infants and
toddlers who have, or are at risk of having, delays or disabilities.
Guided by the philosophy of such a mission statement, the evaluation process should reflect the ongoing collaboration between clinicians and parents in understanding the child and his family and

## Page 52

122 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

should be viewed as the first step in a potential intervention
process.’ Given that a service plan will be written from the findings
of the evaluation, it becomes critical that those findings capture the
infant’s unique developmental strengths and challenges and also
give the parents an opportunity to see and further understand the
developmental issues concerning their child. The evaluation experience should provide the structure for the upcoming short-term
intervention goals and strategies and is obviously not complete
unless it also incorporates the parents’ own concerns and goals for
their child. With the evaluation itself, intervention has already
begun because, given the right evaluation tools—the testing abilities of the service provider and the active involvement of the
family—all the ingredients needed for the determination of an individualized service plan are present.

Unfortunately, most of the traditional screening and evaluation
instruments used in EI are limited in their ability to capture the
early signs of developmental vulnerabilities in the very young
infant because they were not designed to document the qualitative
aspects of early infant behavior and development. In order to
improve eligibility evaluation procedures, EI providers need to
appreciate the complex behavioral repertoire and the dynamic,
reciprocal interactions that newborns and young infants bring to
the world.* Integrating a neurobehaviorally based assessment, such
as the NBO, into the eligibility evaluation and ongoing assessment
of the very young child will provide early interventionists and
families with the best model to meet the needs of families and their
infants in this very early phase of intervention. Only then can we
begin to understand the early developmental agenda of a very
young infant who has had a complex medical history.

NEUROBEHAVIORAL MODELS
The neurobehavioral models proposed by Brazelton° in his work
with full-term infants, and Als,>°’ in her work with preterm infants,
provide a framework for the understanding of neurobehavioral
functioning of the very young infant. Within the framework of
these models, the newborn infant’s capacity to organize his behavior
so that he is able to play an active role in influencing his caregiving
environment and eliciting the support he needs for his development is among the earliest developmental tasks accomplished.**
In order to understand how this model applies to work in EI, the
first step is to learn about infant behavior and early neurobehavioral functioning. Als elaborated on Brazelton’s neurobehavioral

## Page 53

Using the NBO System with At-Risk Infants and Families 123
model of the full-term infant by proposing the synactive theory of
behavioral development, which categorizes behaviors into three
different subsystems: the autonomic system, the motor system, and
the state system. The synactive theory proposes a dynamic interaction of the subsystems with each other and, simultaneously, with
the environment, and so these subsystems are viewed as being both
interdependent and mutually supportive of one another.°*

Within this behavioral framework, infants’ behaviors are seen as
meaningful, communicative, and indicative of the infant’s efforts,
successes, and failures at self-regulation. For each of the subsystems, Als has identified behavioral channels of communication
and describes behaviors as either approach/self-regulatory behaviors or avoidance/stress behaviors. An infant is described as organized when his self-regulatory abilities are able to support the
demands placed on him as demonstrated by his approach behaviors. Conversely, a child is described as disorganized when his
threshold to self-regulation is exceeded and avoidance behaviors
are observed, indicating stress.*’ For example, respiratory rate,
color, and visceral signals are the behavioral channels of the autonomic system. A regular respiratory rate, good color, and stable
digestion are noted in well-organized infants while infants who are
showing signs of disorganization may have irregular breathing,
poor color, and signs of unstable digestion. Within the motor subsystem, organization and disorganization are observed through
muscle tone, postures, and movement patterns. Smooth movements and balanced flexor-extensor tone would be considered
organized behaviors, while jerky movement quality and overuse of
extensor movements would be considered disorganized. The state
system is observed in terms of the range of states of consciousness
available to the infant, the robustness and stability of each state,
and the patterns of transition from state to state.

An infant with a well-organized state system has a broad range
of well-defined states available with smooth transitions from one
state to the next. A less well-organized infant may have a narrower
range of states; states may be more diffuse; and the infant may have
rapid state changes. Attention-interaction is considered an outgrowth of the state subsystem and is observed through the infant’s
ability to respond and interact with animate and inanimate objects.
Infants with well-organized attention-interaction can achieve and
maintain shiny-eyed alertness and well-modulated interactive
periods at least briefly. A less well-organized infant may have
strained, low level alertness or, conversely, may be hyper-alert and
unable to break away from interaction that may be too intense.

## Page 54

124 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

For an infant with well-organized self-regulation, the subsystems
are well integrated and function in smooth synchrony, supporting
and facilitating each other. An infant with less well-organized
self-regulation requires more assistance from adults and the environment to achieve and maintain subsystem interaction and integration. The kind and intensity of facilitation required to achieve
behavioral organization becomes instructive for early interventionists and parents, and can form the basis for individualized goals
and strategies for that infant.*°*

INTEGRATING NBO NEUROBEHAVIORAL
CONCEPTS INTO EI EVALUATION AND
SERVICE PLANNING
The NBO, designed to promote the parent-infant relationship
through behavioral observation, contains several key concepts of
neurobehavioral assessment grounded on synactive theory that
can be integrated into the initial eligibility evaluation and subsequent assessments conducted by EI providers. First, observing the
infant’s behaviors before, during, and following an event (NBO or home
visit), while paying attention to the physical and social contexts,
will help the EI provider understand how a particular infant
responds over time and will provide information on his ability to
maintain an organized state when disturbed and to recover after
disorganization. Therefore, behavioral observation begins the
moment the EI provider enters an infant’s home and ends when he
or she leaves. The infant’s behaviors across the subsystems
described previously are first noted when the EI provider observes
the child before the assessment begins. Notation is made of these
baseline behaviors and of the physical environment and social surroundings of the child. The NBO maneuvers become the event
against which the infant’s neurobehavioral responses will be challenged. In other words, the demands of the evaluation itself become
the structured setting against which stable neurobehavioral
functioning is challenged and measured. The behavioral observation continues throughout the duration of the evaluation with
concurrent observation of specific environmental events, or aspects
of the evaluation itself, that challenge self-regulatory control. Once
the formal evaluation or NBO is completed, the observation is continued for some time in order to document the infant’s recovery
from the stresses of the interaction. The observation of the infant’s
behavior over time will later help the EI provider tell the story of
the event from the infant’s perspective and develop a behavioral

## Page 55

Using the NBO System with At-Risk Infants and Families 125
profile of the infant. This evaluation write-up describes the infant’s
neurobehavioral profile and allows the parents and caregivers to
better understand the individual pattern of response and reactivity
demonstrated by their infant.

A second concept that can be taken from neurobehavioral assessment is the importance of capturing the moment at which the first signs
of disorganization occur. This allows caregivers to identify key events
during the NBO, such as handling or social demands, that trigger
loss of self-regulation and subsequently lead to disorganization.
Understanding and identifying infant sensory thresholds can allow
caregivers to modify environmental and social demands to be more
supportive of infants’ self-regulatory limits. In order for the NBO
to be pursued from this point on, however, EI providers need to be
able to support the infant’s attempts at self-regulation as soon as
signs of disorganization are observed.

This brings us to a third concept of neurobehavioral assessment
that relies on the provider’s ability to offer well-timed individual
assistance and support to the infant that matches his own style and
his attempts at self-regulation. Within this perspective, intervention is aimed at facilitating prolonged periods of organization, thus
decreasing the manifestation of disorganized behaviors while recognizing and reinforcing the infant’s individual self-regulatory
style. For example, well-organized full-term newborns and infants
may be observed bringing themselves into sleep by placing one
hand against the back of the head or behind the ear with the other
hand close to the mouth. Less well-organized infants, such as
infants born prematurely, drug-exposed, or with medical complications may attempt to do the same, but may not be as successful at
maintaining these comfort postures by themselves. Building on
these observations, the caregiver, parent, or service provider can
assist the infant by positioning him sideways (within boundaries to
brace against), by bringing the hand close to the mouth, by offering
a finger to hold, by tucking the legs and allowing the infant to brace
his feet against a hand until he settles down, and in these ways
helping him maintain a state of organized functioning.

CONCLUSION
Although many states require a score from a standardized tool in
order to determine eligibility for EI, the information gathered
during the NBO may provide clinical information needed by the
early interventionist to substantiate eligibility on the basis of
clinical judgment. Behavioral descriptors may be used when infants

## Page 56

126 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

receive a passing score on a standardized tool but show qualitative
dimensions of functioning that are clinically concerning.' For example, one infant may track a red ring with low alertness, paling, and
facial flaccidity, while another infant may track the same red ring
with shiny-eyed alertness, good color, and good muscle tone. While
both infants would receive a passing score on the test item, the
behavioral descriptors give a very different picture of these infants
that would not be available on the basis of scores alone.

The integration of the NBO into the evaluation of high-risk
infants will allow EI providers to meet the three goals of a developmental assessment stated earlier:

1. The infant’s attempts to self-regulate and successes at selfregulation are indicators of the current level of developmental maturity and robustness.

2. The infant’s behavioral manifestations of disorganization or
loss of self-regulation are indicators of developmental vulnerabilities and sensory thresholds.

3. The type and amount of support offered by the examiner
forms the basis of the individualized intervention strategy
and educational approach needed to support the developmental agenda and goals of this infant and promote the
relationship between the infant and his parents and the relationship between the provider and the parents.

Clinical Example

The following example illustrates how the neurobehavioral information
gathered through the NBO provides the EI provider and the parents
with a richer understanding of the infant’s developmental strengths and
vulnerabilities. When I arrived at Eric’s house to conduct his eligibility
evaluation, he was sleeping in his crib. His mother told me that he sleeps
all day and is rarely awake. I told her to let him sleep because I was
interested in his sleep and his waking up. After explaining the content
of the evaluation that was to take place, I flashed a light in Eric’s eyes
and then shook a rattle near his ear for up to 10 times each. Eric
responded to the first four lights by squirming slightly, but then
stopped responding to the subsequent light presentations. He showed a
similar reaction pattern to the rattle presentations. His mother was very
interested in learning about his ability to protect his sleep even when
disturbed by the light and rattle. I then placed Eric on his back and

uncovered him. He stretched his back, arms, and legs for close to 1
minute. He grimaced and fussed but kept his eyes closed.

Eric’s mother commented on Eric’s difficulty in waking up, which
almost always ends in crying after a period of stretching and fussing.
This provided an opportunity for me to talk about state control and state
transition with the mother and explain how some infants show difficulty in this area of their development in the first months of life. I shared
strategies and offered guidance for developmental expectations. I then
examined the tone in his arms and legs. Eric showed a strong response
in all his reflexes; he held his head up during the pull-to-sit maneuver,
and crawled forward by kicking his legs when placed on his stomach.
Because his eyes were still closed, I suggested closing the curtains on the
large living room window to see if less light would make a difference for
him. As soon as the curtains were drawn, Eric opened his eyes. His
mother mentioned she had noticed that he seemed to be most awake
during his night feeding but was not aware that lighting might have
played a role in his ability to be more awake.

Even though Eric remained awake, he showed his sensitivities by
needing to shut out a lot of activity around him; he did so by closing his
eyes often. I picked him up and held him sitting on my lap. When
I shook a rattle next to his ear, he opened his eyes and turned his head
slightly toward the sound of the rattle. His mother then called his name,
and he listened to her voice by quieting his body movement and
becoming very relaxed. His mother mentioned that he quiets to her
voice when he becomes fussy. With slow vertical rocking and removal of
the sweater he had on over his pajamas, Eric gradually became more
awake and was able to turn his head toward his mother’s voice and look
at her. It was the first time she had seen him respond to her voice with
such deliberate action. Soon thereafter, Eric became tired and fussy, letting us know he needed to rest in his crib.

The session ended with a discussion summarizing Eric’s accomplishments and challenges. Eric’s mother was able to identify her infant’s
needs by saying she would assist his efforts at becoming more alert and
stimulate his interest in her voice while giving him opportunities for
quiet sleep when tired. Eric’s mother and I, as the EI provider, both felt
a lot was accomplished during this first visit. I had the information
I needed to develop an individualized service plan that would meet EI
administrative requirements, and Eric’s mother felt she was better
informed about her child’s developmental strengths and challenges.

CHAPTER 12
Early Intervention in
an Australian Setting
BEULAH WARREN
Although Australia is geographically isolated from most of the
Western world—New Zealand being its only western neighbor—
the familial roots of most of the population for a long time have
been in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and North America. In
recent years, with an increase in Asian migration, that pattern has
begun to change. Much has been written of “the tyranny of distance” and its consequences for life in Australia, both socially and
economically. The distance referred to is not only external—
isolation from neighboring countries. It is also internal, for within
Australia a great number of families and communities are geographically isolated and live great distances from many resources,
such as educational facilities and medical expertise, and from the
emotional support of extended family.
In 2000, I wrote:
The emotional threads that are woven through the history of Australia
have relevance to our understanding of infant mental health in Australia at
the end of the twentieth century. There has been a pervasive denial of the
pain of loss:
e Succeeding generations of Australians have struggled with issues of
separation and loss from their birthplaces. Sometimes it was a relief to
be in a new country. For example, for some of the early convicts and
later refugees, Australia represented a new start, but for most there
has been considerable pain at separation from the familiar. For many
there was also the reality of an entirely different, harsh landscape, and
a pioneering culture lacking refinement—true culture shock.
¢ Children have been separated from their parents “for their own good”
since the earliest days of the European colony. It was assumed that
129

convicts were not appropriate parents, and therefore that their
children needed to be raised by others so that they would become
responsible, skilled citizens. In addition, the initial nonexistence of
extended family meant that many of the illegitimate and orphaned
children of the colony were institutionalized. I might add that aboriginal children were also deliberately separated from their parents; they
became known as “the stolen generation.”

e Within rural families many children were sent to board in country
towns or to boarding school, in particular for secondary education,
although some went as young as five or six. In the cities, children of
more affluent families have been separated from their parents and
sent to board at one of the elite private, single-sex schools. Once
again, some for both primary and secondary education.

e It has not been acceptable to own or talk about feelings. Instead, the
expected behavior following separation or loss was to get on with the
task at hand, not dwell on the pain, except to dull it with alcohol or
other substances.

This denial of pain began to slowly change in the latter half of
the last century. It is as if, in the discovery of the baby and the
importance of infancy, the lid was lifted off the nation’s emotions.

In Australia during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, comparable with
what was happening in North America (see Chapter 1), there was
increasing societal and professional awareness that the infant’s
experiences, early interactions, and particularly early human relationships within the family were all significant to later development of the individual. Babies became a focus for clinicians and
researchers. The practice of infant observation as part of psychoanalytic training began in 1968 and within a few years was available
to a wider group of professionals. Infant behavior per se became a
focus of investigation. Dr. Ann Murray, for example, studied
crying.”

This new area of research and clinical observation of the individual characteristics of the infant was consolidated in Australia by the
visit of Dr. T. Berry Brazelton in 1978 and his training of local professionals on the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS).°
Two psychologists who were trained by Dr. Brazelton—Dr. Murray
and Dr. Robyn Dolby—were given permission to train others and
immediately began to do so. The NBAS was embraced by researchers initially, and within a short while by clinicians as well.

Some of the earliest research with the NBAS was in response to
concerns about the consequences of childbirth being considered an
illness and of increasing intervention in the birth process. The medical profession was looking at the effects of birthing practices on
newborns. Research into the effects of medication was conducted

## Page 62

Early Intervention in an Australian Setting 131
in the 1970s. For example, Drs. Murray and Dolby and their
colleagues studied the effects of epidural anesthesia on newborns
and their mothers.* It was not simply the biological or physical
consequences of these practices that were studied, but also the
behavioral outcomes for mothers and infants. The NBAS distinguished the differences between the medicated and unmedicated
babies in terms of motor, state control, and physiological response
clusters, as well as enabled comparisons of their total NBAS scores.
Although the differences between the two groups was less dramatic by the time of discharge on the fifth day, the medicated babies
continued to show poorer state organization, with a labile pattern
in the epidural group and a flat pattern in the oxytocin-epidural
group. In addition, the unmedicated group showed better scores
on the state control items, and they appeared to be well organized.
At one month, the examiners observed few differences between the
groups; in fact, the examiners’ NBAS assessments showed no statistically significant differences between the groups, implying that
drug effects had worn off by 1 month. However, according to
the mothers’ reports, there were subtle behavioral differences, with
mothers of medicated infants reporting their babies to be less
adaptable, more intense, and more bothersome in their behavior.
These mothers also rated their babies on the MABI as having poor
overall performance.° In discussing the results, the authors wondered at the dominance of the baby’s initial behavior in shaping
maternal expectations and interactive styles, and the potential for
this temporary picture to interfere with the development of a reciprocal relationship between mother and baby. These findings had
clinical implications for professionals working with parents and
infants in the early postbirth period.

By the end of the 1970s, research was being conducted into the
consequences of medical practices on infant development, in particular, the consequences of premature birth on later development.°” Publication of studies on the battered child syndrome had
awakened the world to the disturbing realities of child abuse, and
one of the identified at-risk groups was premature infants.* Methods
of intervention to reduce the risks associated with prematurity
were investigated. In Australia, for example, Dr. Dolby and her
associates found that parents of premature newborns identified as
difficult infants appeared to benefit dramatically from early support. At 6-month follow-up, parents of these infants who had
received support were more affectionate and verbally responsive
toward their infants, as well as more aware and active in meeting
their infants’ developmental needs.’

132 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

It was at this time that I joined Dr. Dolby’s team of researchers,
having gained my reliability on the NBAS in 1979. My entry into
this field followed the birth of our third baby. My overall childbirth
experience, especially in the prenatal classes, where there was little
or no emphasis on the baby, was an epiphany for me. I changed the
topic of my Master’s thesis so I could investigate how professionals
could help parents prepare for the reality of the newborn as a
unique individual: How to get to know their baby.

Dr. Dolby’s team received a grant to evaluate a preventive care
program that could be incorporated into any basic follow-up service for low birthweight infants over the first year. The intervention
flowed from assessment, incorporated parents’ perceptions of their
infants’ behavior, and was implemented through day-to-day
handling, for which parents took responsibility. The NBAS was
used as a baseline measure and initial intervention tool at 36, 40,
and 44 weeks.

In 1983, Dr. Dolby and I visited Boston and worked with Kevin
Nugent and Berry Brazelton, obtaining our qualifications as trainers, and with Heidelise Als, from whom we gained valuable insights
for our work with premature infants.

Then in 1985, Dr. Dolby and I were appointed to the NICU at
Westmead Hospital, a new tertiary hospital in a fast-growing area
of Sydney; there, we were given the opportunity to implement an
intervention program. Our task was to develop a Growth and
Development Clinic for the graduates of the NICU—premature
infants less than 1,500 g at birth and other at-risk infants. The NBAS
was used to assess the babies prior to discharge and at 1-month
after discharge. The goal was to help parents in two ways: first, to
help them understand the behavior of their small, often fragile
infants; and second, to address their concerns. The parents were
grateful to be shown their babies’ unique characteristics, to be told
what extra help their infants required, and to find out what their
babies’ strengths were. Parents grew in confidence as their observations of their babies were validated. They felt less anxious as
their questions were answered and they were able to recognize
their newborns’ capabilities. The infants were scheduled to return
at key points of development over the first 3 years, when assessments were used to identify risks and strengths, and parents once
again had the opportunity to raise questions they had regarding
their children’s progress. Parents were provided with guidance as
to how they could help their children meet the next developmental
challenges, and referrals to additional services were made, as
necessary.

## Page 64

Early Intervention in an Australian Setting 133

For the past 20 years, my primary professional focus has been as
a clinician, thus my experience with the NBAS has been training
professionals in its use, and using it clinically as an early intervention tool. Many professionals, both clinicians and researchers, have
requested training and completed the 1-day orientation to the
NBAS. Some have gained the required experience and returned to
complete the NBAS certification process. Among these have been a
neonatolgist and allied health team members in neonatal nurseries,
as well as other health professionals working with infants in maternity and children’s hospitals and postbirth mother-and-baby units.
In 1988, I took the position of foundation coordinator of the Early
Intervention Program (EIP) at the Royal Hospital for Women,
Sydney. This was a home-visiting program for infants at risk, from
0 to 3 years. A multidisciplinary team of six clinicians and an administrative assistant staffed the program. It was a parent-infant unit
based on the Child Development Unit model of Dr. Selma Fraiberg."”
The focus was the relationship between parent and infant and the
importance of being conscious of the contribution of each.

No matter what their disciplines, all of the EIP clinicians were
trained on the NBAS because there is no better tool to gain an awareness of the specific attributes of a baby and how those attributes will
influence the baby’s contribution to interaction with his or her
mother or father. The Royal Hospital for Women had a level III
NICU. One third of the referrals to the EIP were families with premature infants. We met the families in the nursery, using the NBAS
to reinforce parents’ knowledge of their babies. The families were
visited at regular intervals, as necessary, over the early years.

For a number of families, the NBAS was a key factor in the intervention. Following are two examples that illustrate this point.

Clinical Examples

Alicia and Her Family

Alicia was born at 28 weeks gestational age to parents who were both

professionals in their mid-30s. The mother, Gayle, had had a miscar
riage a short time before becoming pregnant with Alicia. Her pregnancy
had been difficult and, at 28 weeks, following a visit to the obstetrician,

Gayle was admitted to hospital with hypertension. She was transferred

to the tertiary hospital, and the following morning Alicia was born by

emergency cesarean section, weighing 825 g, with Apgar scores of 4

and 9. Alicia’s progress in the nursery was not easy. She had hyaline

membrane disease, apnea, chronic lung disease, and necrotizing
(Continued )

134 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

enterocolitis, but no periventricular hemorrhage. She required mechanical ventilation for 36 days, multiple peripheral arterial lines, and
phototherapy because her bilirubin level rose to 117 (mc mol/1); in
addition, she received a blood transfusion and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 10 days. Alicia was a very active baby and was slow to
gain weight. By the time discharge was planned, she was 16 weeks postbirth, 3.5 weeks corrected age, having been in the hospital for 108 days.
Her weight was 2,260 g. The nursery staff referred the family to the EIP
because of the parents’ anxiety, describing them as “the most anxious
parents” they had ever seen. Alicia was described as “hard to settle”
and a “wound-up” baby.

I met Gayle in the rooming-in facility where we discussed Alicia and
her progress to date. Alicia was sleeping, so we talked a little about how
Alicia had been since being moved into Gayle’s room. Gayle said
that Alicia had been restless that morning, not settling down to sleep.
I explained that Alicia may need assistance to get into a curled posture
that would enable her to be still and get into a deep sleep. I demonstrated how Alicia could be wrapped to keep her flexed, and encouraged Gayle to hold Alicia until she felt her body become still before
placing her in the bassinette. Gayle responded with great interest and
invited me to meet her husband, John, the following day, prior to their
departure.

The next day, I stopped by the room only to discover that Alicia was
back in the nursery. “She was a bit snuffly,” Gayle said, explaining that
they were not taking her home that day because she had the flu. She
commented that they had “waited so long, another few days won't
matter.” I commiserated, and we talked for a few moments. Gayle told
me that the baby was booked in until the following Monday. I said that
she would probably only stay the one night. Gayle gasped. I realized,
then, how terrified Gayle was to take her baby home, and that the staff,
both nursing and medical, were all caught up in the family’s anxiety.
Babies 4 weeks post due date, doing well medically, did not usually stay
another week because they were “snuffly.”

I sat down with the mother and father and said quietly, “It is a pretty
scary prospect, isn’t it, taking home a new small baby?” With this, Gayle
burst into tears and sobbed while she told me the extent of her fears and
her sense of helplessness. We looked at possible supports. I assured her
that I would visit her at her home—some considerable distance from the
hospital.

When we met the following week, we focused on how Gayle had
managed her care of Alicia while rooming in, what she had discovered
about her new baby, and what strategies had worked to settle Alicia. We
talked about wrapping Alicia to contain her movement for quiet times
and also for sleep. I stressed that most premature babies prefer stimulation with one modality at a time in the early months. John was taking
the week off, and they agreed to return the following week so we could
do an assessment using the NBAS.

## Page 66

Early Intervention in an Australian Setting 135

By the time they returned, John had already learned that if he curled
Alicia in his arms, she could snuggle in and relax her tight little body.
John filmed the assessment and we reviewed the film together. The
parents saw from the assessment that their little girl was relatively
robust, and also that she was very responsive to voices. Gayle told me
some months later that they took her home that day and talked to her,
using their voices to soothe and settle her and also to provide stimulation in quiet alert times. She also reported that in those first weeks
Alicia’s cries didn’t seem like crying, but more like a bleating demand,
“T want to be held.” And so they held her, wrapped and curled. In being
held, Alicia gained control of her body and was able to be still and settle.
Gayle gained confidence in knowing she could bring her baby back to a
calm base. The tightness in Alicia’s muscular system relaxed, and by
9 months she had made good progress.

Emily and Her Family

Emily was born by an emergency cesarean section at 38 weeks because of
pregnancy-induced hypertension. She was admitted to the Neonatal Care
Nursery for birth asphyxia, absent fetal movement (10 hours), profound
hypoglycemia, and her poor condition following birth. In the nursery,
she was intubated and monitored. Her Apgar scores were 1 and 6; her
birthweight 2,610 g; and her initial head circumference, 34.5 cm. The
pathological disease processes documented in the NICU indicated
hypoxic brain damage with definite neonatal seizures. In treating Emily
in the NICU, the following procedures were required: parenteral nutrition; headbox oxygen; a head ultrasound, which showed cerebral edema
and apneic spells; an EEG, which revealed frontal sharp activity and good
background rhythm; and a CAT scan, which showed computerized tomography consistent with ischemic insult in the frontal lobe.

Emily was the second child of Meg and Graham. Their first child,
Toby, was 2 years and 6 months at the time of Emily’s birth. Meg and
Graham had been married for approximately 6 years when Emily was
born. The referral to EIP was made by Emily’s pediatrician who
explained that prior to the birth the mother, Meg, had presented to her
obstetrician at 38 weeks, saying she had not felt any movements that
day. The reasons for the referral were to provide emotional support to
the parents, to give them an opportunity to share their anxiety about the
uncertain outcome for their infant, and to conduct a neonatal assessment of the infant and provide developmental guidance to the parents.
When the pediatrician phoned, Emily was 2 weeks old and doing well.
She was medicated. He asked me to come to the nursery to meet the
parents. The pediatrician wanted Emily followed because he was uncertain of her prognosis.

The NBAS assessment in the nursery showed that Emily had solid
sleep states; however, she moved rapidly from deep sleep to a fussy
awake state. Robust crying was observed. In fact, she was predominantly

136 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

fussing and crying. Because Emily became very distressed, the more
invasive items of the NBAS were not completed. When she was quietly
active, Emily tried to get her hand to her mouth to calm herself. Once
upset—although she tried to quiet herself at the sound of a voice—Emily
needed to be picked up, wrapped, and given the pacifier before she quieted. When dressed, wrapped, and sucking on the pacifier, Emily was
able to focus briefly and follow a face and voice for 30 degrees to the left
and right before becoming overloaded. The infant’s muscle tone was
variable; she was very active, especially when upset, and her movements were jerky. She was very red when crying, from early in the
examination. No tremors or startles were noticed.

I shared the assessment with the parents, explaining that all infants
want to establish an equilibrium of regular sleep, wakefulness, and
feeding routines. Establishing this kind of balance was particularly difficult for Emily because of her birth trauma. I shared with Meg and
Graham suggestions for handling their baby: wrapping her for sleep
and quiet times; encouraging sleep for 14 to 18 hours in 24; talking
to Emily to contain her extra movement and distressed states and to
help her settle; and, finally, encouraging flexion by wrapping and holding her in a flexed position. Three days later, the family took Emily
home. Initially, she was relatively easy, sleeping and eating regularly.
The family returned to EIP 2 weeks postdischarge.

During the postdischarge NBAS, Emily became very upset, and once
again the more invasive items were not completed. However, she also
had periods of quiet alertness, when she focused and responded to several stimuli by following for 60 degrees to the left and right. She was
able to quiet herself when active, but not when very distressed (State 6).
In short, there had been considerable improvement in Emily’s orientation, regulation of state, and motor regularity in 2 weeks, although some
tremulousness was observed, and her color changes were still marked.

Meg and Graham were pleased with Emily’s progress. The family
lived about 50 kilometers from the hospital, but Meg’s mother lived in a
closer suburb; and because Meg visited her mother regularly, we agreed
to meet at her mother’s home as the need arose. A third NBAS was completed a short time later, and the orientation cluster was noticeably
improved. Emily responded to all items, and there was less tremulousness and more stable color. However, her range of state, regulation of
state, and motor control did not show improvement from the second
assessment. She did show increased motor tone and stronger extension
on handling. Emily worked hard on self-regulation; she tried to use her
power of concentration to keep herself calm by locking onto someone or
something with her eyes. Meg and Graham spoke of increased irritability during the day but said that Emily was sleeping longer at night.
They both used a sling to carry her. As phenobarbitone was reduced,
Emily became more unsettled, crying for long periods during the day.

Over the ensuing weeks, Emily continued to be extremely sensitive,
not allowing the pediatrician or others to assess her because of her

irritability—initially allowing only her mother to hold and settle her.
Her parents clung to the image of Emily as an alert baby, and to the fact
that over time she had shown some improvement in her efforts to quiet
herself. At around 4 months, Graham phoned to say he was worried
about Meg, wondering whether she was depressed. He talked about
how difficult it was for Meg to not be getting enough sleep and to have
Emily be so demanding, still not settling for anyone else. I reassured
him that they were going through an extraordinarily difficult time; that
they were not doing anything wrong; that they were good parents; and
that Toby, their 2-year-old son, was evidence of this. I agreed to meet
Meg at her mother’s home every 2 weeks. At Meg’s mother’s home,
because of Emily’s sensitivity to handling, we would make a hammock
from a sheet and rock her to sleep. Graham decided to take a long service leave, and during that period, Emily began to let him settle her
as well.

At 9 months, Jan, the physiotherapist on the team, performed a motor
assessment. Her approach was to work with a doll and let the parent
handle the child. As Jan talked with Meg, little Toby quietly played with
the doll. Jan looked down and saw that in his play, Toby had taken a cotton band and placed it across the doll’s mouth. Toby was telling us of
his experience with his little sister. It was about this time that Meg
phoned to say that Toby’s behavior had deteriorated. He had been so
cooperative during the early months of Emily’s life but was now being
cheeky and defiant. I said we could discuss what might be happening
during my next visit. When I arrived, Meg said that Toby had asked if
he could talk with me, too. So from then on, during each visit, Toby and
I would talk about his feelings toward his little sister, and how hard it
was not being able to do the things he wanted to with mum and dad.
Emily continued to slowly improve. Developmentally, she was progressing well, but behavioral regulation remained a challenge. It was
not until Emily was about 11 months that she would let her grandmother hold and comfort her.

Meg learned to manage Emily’s sensitivity. She spoke about taking
Emily, then 10 or 11 months, to be fitted for her first pair of shoes. Emily
screamed every time the shop assistant tried to measure her foot, or fit a
shoe; the assistant suggested returning on another day, but Meg assured
him it would make no difference. Meg took the shoes home. Over the
next few weeks, she worked on increasing Emily’s tolerance to them, at
first putting them on and taking them off almost immediately, then
keeping the shoes on for a few minutes while Emily sat in the high chair,
then increasing the time the shoes were kept on, until finally, Emily fell
in love with her new shoes.

As Emily’s development improved, Meg managed to get more sleep,
and Toby’s behavior settled down again. However, when Emily was
around 16 months, Graham phoned and asked to come and see me. He
was feeling very depressed and, in fact, suicidal. The months of holding
the family together had taken their toll, and he finally recognized that

psychiatrist for medication and a short term of therapy, which he did.

At 12 months, Emily’s score on the Bayley Mental Scales (MDI) was

122 and on the Motor Scale (PDI) was 80. The assessment at 18 months

was a joy to do. Emily’s Bayley scores were MDI 123, PDI 107. At 3,

Emily went to preschool. Meg reported that Emily loved school, but still

had certain sensitivities; for example, she preferred a little distance

between herself and her playmates. She managed this by being the
organizer and taking charge of the games. My last contact with the fam
ily was a photo I received showing Emily, 5 years, with Toby, on the day

she started at the local school.

CONCLUSION
The essential elements of the NBAS can be summarized in the
following way:

e Observing babies and infants provides information about
their unique characteristics, as well as their needs and
strengths. This capacity to observe infants is a crucial skill in
all infant-parent work, just as observation is crucial in working with older children.

e Focusing on the best performance of the infant, rather than a
deficit model, allows the parents to maximize the baby’s
development.

e The NBAS’s capacity to elicit the individuality of the baby
allows the parents to focus on their baby, rather than on how
she compares with another baby.

e The message of the NBAS—that infants communicate and that
their behavior can tell us about their needs—is still a mystery
to most new parents, not just to parents of at-risk infants. Sharing this message with the widest possible audience is the challenge for all professionals with an understanding of infants’
needs and is the focus of my own teaching and practice.

In 1974, as a young pediatrician, I (NJK) spent my community
pediatric rotation in the northeastern province of Thailand, Ubonrajathanee. This experience gave me a firsthand opportunity to
work with children and families affected by poverty, malnutrition,
and preventable diseases. During my pediatric training at the
Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, I
had learned that there was a 60% prevalence of protein energy
malnutrition in children under the age of 5 among rural and poor
urban populations in Thailand. Troubled by this reality, I was puzZled by some traditional practices that seemed detrimental to the
healthy growth and development of babies, especially the taboo
against nutritious food for pregnant and new mothers. In addition,
it was believed that early yellowish breast milk, or colostrum, was
“unripe” or inadequate for the nutritional needs of the new baby.
As a result, breastfeeding was not properly practiced, and that led
to early feeding of semi-solid food, mostly mashed banana and
chewed glutinous rice, beginning in the first few weeks of life.

Moreover, there was a belief that no one should show affection
for or admire new babies in case the evil spirits might “take the
baby away.” Instead, it was believed that those looking at a newborn for the first time should say that the baby was ugly—to deceive
the “ghosts/evil spirits” and to prevent them from taking the baby.
These traditional practices and this belief in “the evil eye” was a
longstanding cultural adaptation to historically high incidences of

maternal and infant mortality. I decided there needed to be a more
constructive solution to address this fear—a completely different
approach to conventional maternal health education. More knowledge was needed.

After completing my rotation in the northeast in 1978, I attended
the first International Brain Research Organization training workshop in basic neuroscience, which had been organized by
Naiphinich (Nick) Kotchabhakdi in Bangkok. It was here that I was
exposed to new research on the contrasting effects of enriched and
impoverished environments on the developing brains of experimental animals. I was impressed and wanted to know if there was
any research on the effects of early environment on human infants.
This led me to the work of Berry Brazelton on the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and the research of Brazelton and
Tronick on the interaction between mother and young infant, the
“face-to-face paradigm.” What Brazelton described was totally new
and different from the conventional pediatric textbooks, which
said, for example, that infants only began to see by the age of about
3 months. I made up my mind that I would find a way to learn
more about babies’ behavior and this amazing scale. Nine months
at the Harvard School of Public Health and Graduate School of
Education gave me this opportunity. There, I was able to develop
broader perspectives on issues of health, nutrition, and child
development when considered in the varied contexts of the ecological system, social policy, and health system management. Several
weeks after arriving in Boston, I began to learn about NBAS with
Dr. Brazelton and Kevin Nugent at the Child Development Unit at
the Children’s Hospital in Boston and became certified in the use
of the NBAS. Learning the NBAS had a greater impact on me than
I had anticipated. It sharpened my observation skills with newborn
infants and their parents. Above all, it helped me better understand
myself. The systematic observation and recording of the behavior
of individual newborn infants helped me understand the newborn
as a person. At the same time, the concept of “best performance”
and using the baby’s behavior as a language made each encounter
with children and families an opportunity to learn and to share.
I realized that my patients had much to teach me, yet I also became
more confident in my ability to understand and communicate with
newborn infants and, in fact, with every person I encountered.

Returning to Thailand in 1980, I established the Child Development Unit in the Department of Pediatrics at the Faculty of Medicine,
Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, and introduced the
NBAS to my pediatric and OB-GYN colleagues, nurses, and residents.

142 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

Later, I was invited to join the research team on a project that
was designed to reduce protein energy malnutrition among young
children under the age of 5. Pattanee Winichakul, a nutritionist colleague, and I spent time in remote villages among people with the
lowest incomes. When we visited a 4-month-old baby’s home, the baby
became involved in a wonderful, reciprocal vocal and social interaction with me. The mother became interested and observed with
pride that her baby knew and played with me, the doctor from
Bangkok. I turned to her, put the baby in her arms, and said, “Let’s
see how the baby will respond to you.” The baby made eye contact,
smiled, and cooed with his mother; and the mother-baby dyad
began to “dance” merrily in reciprocal interaction. The mother’s
face lit up as much as the baby’s. When the father approached and
the baby looked away, I explained that the baby needed to take a
break. After a while, the father and the baby played and interacted;
then the older siblings also participated. It was beyond my expectations that the atmosphere of this house could be so quickly and totally
changed into a joyful and lively place. It also took me by surprise
that these parents had completely overlooked their baby’s competence and the importance of one-to-one positive interaction with their
infant, even though this was their fourth child. That experience led
me to collaborate with colleagues from the Institute of Nutrition,
Mahidol University (INMU), and design a series of educational
videos for parents that included the perception and orientation
components of the NBAS, in addition to nutrition components. Five
of those titles are described briefly here:

1. Our Beloved Children compared the development of two
15-month-old boys, one malnourished, the other well nourished.

2. BreastFeeding emphasized the value of breastfeeding (nutrients and other benefits) and provided instructions on how to
breastfeed.

3. Supplemental Feeding described the ingredients of good supplementary food, how to cook to preserve nutrients, and how
to feed a child at different ages. It also promoted a nutritious
combination of rice, beans, and sesame.

4. Dr. Nitt Is Coming focused on newborn perceptual and interactive ability, mother-infant interaction and breastfeeding, the
growth of attachment, and how to read a child’s communication cues.

5. Moo Baan Saen Som Boon used animated puppets to present
the five food groups in the context of a battle in a village that
was fighting the “malnutrition devil.”

## Page 75

Reaching Out to Rural Communities 143
To test the effectiveness of this form of educational outreach, a
controlled study was conducted in 16 villages in the northeastern
area of Thailand. The video series was shown in a mobile van twice
a week in two groups of four villages. In the first group of villages,
the videos were reinforced with radio spots; in the second group of
villages, there were no radio spots. The third group, which included
four other villages, was exposed to the radio spots only, while
the fourth group of four villages, which served as a control group,
was not exposed to any of these educational media. In this controlled follow-up study, the findings after 18 months revealed that in
villages exposed to the interactive video, more mothers fed their
babies colostrum, continued breastfeeding more successfully, and
introduced semisolid supplementary food at 4 to 6 months.’ The
mothers’ nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP)
were recorded and were found to be significantly different among
the four groups. Increased exposure to educational messages
(video and radio > video alone > radio alone) were related to more
positive parent-child interactions and more successful breastfeeding.” As a result, between 1988 and 1992, the video Dr. Nitt Is Coming
was used in health centers in prenatal and well child-care clinics
throughout Thailand. It was broadcast on national television and
used for training a range of groups, including medical students,
nurses, and child-care providers. The Department of Health incorporated the concept in its comprehensive well child-care program,
integrating the early childhood development component with promotion of immunization and growth monitoring. Child developmental monitoring and promotion has been included in the
Home-Based Child Health Record. Since 2000, a nutrition and
child development corner has been established in all 7,000 health
centers and 600 district hospitals throughout Thailand, with more
effective programming for family empowerment. Moreover, parts
of VIR number 1 and 4 were used in the Unicef training package
on Early Childhood Care and Development in developing countries. Later in 1990, there was a wonderful opportunity to introduce newborn behavior and competence to the world’s leaders.
At the United Nations’ World Summit Education for All in Jom
Tien, Thailand, I (NJK) collaborated with Robert Myers and the
Consultative Group on ECCD and presented “Foundation of
Human Learning,” a VTR along with the symposium to emphasize the concept that learning begins at birth, not in primary
schools, and the implications for programming. Subsequently, Unicef
and UNESCO made the VTR available for related organizations in
many countries.

144 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

In 1995, I (NJK) became an NBAS instructor and established the
NBAS training center at Ramathibodi Hospital in affiliation with
the Brazelton Institute in Boston. The National Institute for Child
and Family Development was established in Mahidol University
Salaya campus in 1997, for research, higher education and model
development. The Salaya community participatory project for the
betterment in child health and development has been one of the
successful models for local capacity building and empowerment of
families. Another channel to disseminate the information about
newborn behavior and early learning has been the inclusion in the
Thai versions of “Facts for Life’’ and eventually in the third international version.

In 2005, 25 years after establishing the first child development
unit in Thailand, and after 13 years of unofficial fellowship training, the field of Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics (DBP) was
granted official status as a subspecialty of Pediatrics by the Royal
College of Pediatricians of Thailand and the Medical Council of
Thailand. The first national DBP sub-board examination took place
in June 2007, with 19 applicants. The NBAS and the Touchpoints
concepts were included in the DBP fellowship training. In the
future, it is hoped that the NBAS and the Neonatal Behavioral
Observations (NBO) training will help parents understand their
newborn infants’ behavior and thus promote positive relationships
between parents and infants from the beginning in the understaffed
hospitals in Thailand. As of December 2007, Thailand has a new
public law for the promotion of development of children and youth
and also a national policy to enhance early childhood care and
development. The recognition of the newborn as a person will certainly support the implementations for future social development
and human security.

Maternal-Child and Family
Nursing and Preventive
Intervention: United States
KRISTIE BRANDT
Assisted by a supportive nurse and attentive nurse-midwife, a
woman and her partner have worked through a challenging and
arduous labor to bring their young daughter into the world.
Exhausted and exhilarated, they hold their daughter and lift her
into the air in front of them. In this moment, every movement,
physical characteristic, sound, smell, taste, and touch of their infant
has intense meaning. This baby’s life is dependent on her ability to
entice these parents into caring for her, meeting her primary needs
for food, warmth, and safety, and her basic need for love and
human connectedness. She has been born uniquely prepared for
this important task with a repertoire of behaviors and other capacities to draw in and captivate her parents. Of this phenomenon,
Bowlby wrote, “It is fortunate for their survival that babies are so

designed by nature that they beguile and enslave mothers.”

Suspended in this moment and accompanied by parental joy,
mourning, and readjustment is the fading fantasy baby of pregnancy, that is gradually being replaced by the real baby at birth, as
each new characteristic of the newborn is assimilated.” This process
will be fueled by such overt observations and experiences as the
physical appearance or crying of the infant, and those that are virtually imperceptible, such as the infant’s ability to synchronize
movements in rhythm with the mother’s voice.* These all have a
powerful impact and meaning for the new parent, and—coupled
with the neonate’s ability to look at, mimic, reach for, and respond

to the parent—provide the repertoire and capacities for the beguilement described by Bowlby.

The baby searches the unfamiliar faces of her parents and they
search back, each recording every movement and sound. As
they attend to postdelivery work, the RN and nurse-midwife watch
too, and they are also taking note of every movement and sound.
Highly skilled in observation, one nurse whispers to the new
mother, “Look how she turns toward your face when you talk,”
and the other comments on the nice Moro reflex exhibited by the
baby when a hallway door closes a little too loudly. Subtly, these
health-care professionals are implementing a vital, lifesaving, and
life-changing intervention that will impact this infant, her family,
and the public health of her community throughout her lifetime.
By pointing out the cues and behaviors of the baby and assisting
the parents to see and understand their daughter’s behavioral language, the nurses are working to ensure the baby’s health, wellbeing, safety, and optimal development. When the capacities of the
newborn match the expectations of the parent in this sensitive
period after birth, innate caregiving responses are elicited that fuel
the process of attachment.* Gradually the baby becomes more
familiar, behavioral language more meaningful, and the parents
are falling in love with her—an essential ingredient of assuring that
they will work hard at helping their baby thrive.*

While the art and science of nursing is focused on protecting,
promoting, and optimizing health and abilities,” the specialty of
Maternal-Child and Family (MCF) nursing is principally concerned
with the health, development, and functioning of: the mother
(throughout pregnancy, the intrapartum period, and the postpartum experience); the fetus, newborn, and young child; and, the family
as the unit that will nurture the child. After the obvious first objective of securing a safe passage for the dyad through the pregnancy
and birth, the most important MCF nursing objective is to support
the process of the parent and child “falling in love” with one
another. In a practical sense, this helps secure the survival of the
infant, but in a more expansive view, it fosters the optimal development of both parent and child and simultaneously builds the foundation for caretaking behaviors by the parent and positive biological
responses in the infant that are fundamental to lifelong health and
well-being.°”*

From a public health perspective, this scaffolding of the parentchild relationship is likely the second most important intervention
for the young child (the first being the physical health and survival of the newborn), because the success of any future parental or

systems-based public health interventions on behalf of the infant or
focused on the child in the context of the larger community will
rely heavily on the strength and functionality of the parent-child
relationship. For example, parents who know their baby’s cues, are
invested in seeing their child thrive, and develop functional parenting patterns, are far more likely to engage in positive and preventative health practices on behalf of the child (well-child visits,
breastfeeding, immunizations, child safety practices, etc.), thus
contributing to the health of both the infant and the community at
large.71011215/1415

Research in the past two decades increasingly suggests an association between adverse childhood experiences (abuse, neglect, or
dysfunctional parenting) and negative childhood and adult health
outcomes, including a greater incidence of depression and chronic
fatigue, as well as a lower subjective rating of overall health and
well-being.'*'”'® Many studies have found a strong relationship
between child maltreatment or childhood household dysfunction
and serious, chronic adult health problems, including cigarette
smoking, ischemic heart disease, obesity, physical inactivity, and
substance abuse.'®”””° Staggering amounts of money are spent each
year in responding to the long-term consequences of problems in
the parent-child relationship, and Dallam (2001) concludes that
“the cost of doing nothing is simply too great.”*!”

So what are the preventive interventions that nurses can employ
to enhance the protective factors for a child? In Neurons to Neighborhoods, Shonkoff and Phillips quote T. Berry Brazelton, Robert Emde,
and Daniel Stern: “When young children and their caregivers are
tuned in to each other, and when caregivers can read the child’s
emotional cues and respond appropriately to his or her needs in a
timely fashion, their interactions tend to be successful and the relationship is likely to support healthy development in multiple
domains.” The two authors go on to conclude that “Most successful interventions, whether they are primarily preventive or therapeutic, are based on facilitating that relationship and helping both
the child and the caregiver learn to adapt successfully to each
other’s individuality.”* The lifelong risks are obvious, and the primary preventive intervention clear: Scaffold and facilitate the early
relationship between parent and child by supporting parents in
seeing and responding to the behavioral cues of their newborn.

In the first 8 weeks after birth, the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) offers the MCF nurse a stellar tool for showcasing and observing the newborn’s individuality as expressed in his
or her mastery and clarity of cues and other behavioral repertoire,

## Page 82

Maternal-Child and Family Nursing and Preventive Intervention 149
and parental meaning-making. This sophisticated interventive
strategy consists of eliciting and showcasing the infant’s behaviors,
observing parental response to the behaviors, and exploring with
parents the meaning they make of the behaviors, and it affords the
provider insight into the parents’ experience and understanding of
the baby. This positions the parent as the expert on the child, and
scaffolds parent and infant as their relationship and ways of being
together expand.

With a look of awe and pleasure on their faces, a woman and her
partner watch the nurse as she conducts the NBAS at the bedside.
When doing the Pull-to-Sit maneuver, the nurse gently pulls on the
newborn’s hands and arms to bring her from a reclining to a sitting
position. As the baby comes upright, her head moves forward and
the parents’ expressions change to fear and concern. Reflexively,
the mother reaches for the baby with an exclamation of, “Oh!” The
baby looks up toward the mother, pulls her head more solidly to
midline, and stabilizes her head so she can stare at her mother. The
nurse lowers the baby back to the reclining position and asks the
mother, “What do you make of that?” The mother explains how
she was wotried the baby’s head would “flop over and hurt her
neck,” but she goes on to say that she didn’t know the baby was so
strong, remarking, “She just lifted her head up and looked right at
me.” The nurse hands the baby back to the mother who cradles the
baby close to her body and brushes her hand across the baby’s
head. The baby relaxes, opens her eyes, and stares into her mother’s face again. The mother’s expression softens, and she smiles at
her daughter.

In this brief and seemingly insignificant interaction, powerful
messages have been exchanged. The baby has seen that something
she did (looking at her mother during the Pull-to-Sit maneuver,
then staring at her mother’s face when being cuddled) changed
something about her mother (the mother reached for the baby when
their eyes met in the Pull-to-Sit, and the mother smiled when the
baby looked at her while being cuddled). The mother has learned
that something she did (an exclamation, reaching for the baby, then
cuddling her baby) changed something about the baby (she relaxed,
stayed in a quiet alert state, and stared at her mother).

Exchanges such as these awaken a deep sense of caring and a
desire to protect the infant. It is this very connection that is called
on when the parent is engaged on behalf of the child in any of a
host of behaviors that will contribute to the child’s health and
development: Sitting down to read to her daughter (early literacy),
securing her in a car seat (child safety), breastfeeding her and later

## Page 83

150 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

making certain she has other quality food to eat (nutrition), taking

her for well-child examinations and immunizations (preventive

health), going for walks with her (physical activity and exercise),
providing warm and nurturing care (relationships and. socialemotional development), and so on.

The Pull-to-Sit episode described was an actual encounter, and
the dialogue continues:

Nurse: “She worked really hard at that task.”

Mother: “I know. I really do think she’s strong, don’t you?”

Nurse: “I do, too. And, she looked right at you when you said
‘Oh.’”

Mother: “I know. I think she knows I’m her mom.”

Nurse: “I think she does, too. And, when you cuddled her, she
relaxed and looked right at you again.”

Mother: “I know. I love it when she looks at me.” (The new
mother looks back down at her baby and smiles.)

Nurse: “I thought she might cry after I pulled her up to sit, but she
didn’t. She had a sort of worried look like she might cry, but
she really relaxed when you cuddled her. And, now she’s
looking at you with such interest.”

Mother: “T just can’t believe she knows me already.”

The Pull-to-Sit maneuver, just one element of the 28 behavioral
and 18 reflex items of the NBAS, provided the opportunity for this
simple yet powerful intervention. The baby has been credited
with physical strength, with the ability to regulate her state,
and with relaxing in response to her mother’s caregiving efforts.
The mother is credited with being a source of comfort and security
for her baby; plus, her sense that her baby is strong and knows who
her mother is has been affirmed. Such exchanges strengthen the
parent-child relationship, enhance the protective factor of a secure
attachment, and bode well for the baby’s future.

Since its development, the NBAS has provided a tool for observing, assessing, understanding, and transmitting information on
the capacities of the newborn. While it is first a systematized, rigorous, and uniform research tool, the hidden value of the NBAS is
the respect, appreciation, and wonder it engenders in both provider and parent for the newborn’s characteristics, behavioral
language, and repertoire for interacting.

For more than 3 decades now, the NBAS has informed the discipline of nursing and contributed to both the development of clinical care models and the refinement of specific intervention,

## Page 84

Maternal-Child and Family Nursing and Preventive Intervention 151
facilitation, and support strategies. It has contributed immeasurably
to nursing knowledge and the implementation of “best practices”
in the care of newborns, pregnant women, and parenting families
in a variety of situations, including: (1) newborns prenatally
exposed to drugs or alcohol, (2) infants with colic,” (3) the role of
fathers,” (4) attachment,” (5) caring for infants with macrosomia,*
(6) primary care of the infant and family,” (7) parental caretaking
tasks,*° (8) routine neonatal nursing care*'; and very significantly to
an understanding of the cultural variations relative to both the
newborn’s behavioral repertoire and the meaning of infant behavior
to the parent.”

In addition, the NBAS has influenced programs that have dramatically advanced MCF nursing in the past 20 years. For example,
the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment
Program training process (NIDCAP), developed by Heidelise Als,
Ph.D., has profoundly changed the way in which neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) staff, particularly nurses, are trained, and the
environment and care provided for preterm, low birthweight, and
other infants in the NICU.****»

The remarkable work of Kathryn Barnard, RN, Ph.D. and the
Barnard Model of caregiver-infant interaction, with the NCAST
Parent-Child Interaction (PCI) Feeding and Teaching Assessments
and the Keys to Caregiving training series, has elevated the practice and impact of MCF nursing by providing nurses and other
professionals with new knowledge, skill and expertise for working
with newborns, young infants and their caregivers.*’**’As colleagues of many years, Brazelton and Barnard have had substantial
influence on one another’s contribution to this field. It is worth
noting that 2 years before it was first published, Brazelton and his
colleagues presented an unpublished paper on the NBAS for
Dr. Barnard’s Nursing Child Assessment Project at the University
of Washington in February 1971.9%°7°8

The rigor of the NBAS, including the time required for training,
developing expertise in, and administering this tool, has limited its
use in the United States and internationally. Recently, the Newborn
Behavioral Observations (NBO) system was developed by Nugent,
Keefer, Minear, Johnson, and Blanchard to address this.*° The NBO
can be learned quickly, and use of this observational system can be
implemented rapidly in delivering hospitals, perinatal home visiting units, and health-care offices. Incorporation of this tool should
be a critical goal for MCF nursing services in any setting where
nurses work with infants and their families in the first 8 weeks after
birth. The NBO is probably best implemented in settings where

## Page 85

152 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

providers using the system can work in collaboration with a
colleague who is skilled and certified in use of the NBAS, and can
provide appropriate consultation if the NBO reveals responses or
behaviors that the observer is unfamiliar with or believes to be
problematic.

From the perspective of the discipline of nursing, “best practice”
in the care of children and their families lies in a multidisciplinary
approach. In 1971, Reeder wrote that “health professionals find
themselves in the center of a revolution in the health-care system,”
and “only by multidisciplinary collaboration will they be able to
rise to the occasion and provide adequate health services” for children and their families.*\"? More than 30 years since that was
written, a multidisciplinary approach remains at the heart of a
functional system of care that meets the needs of families. Perhaps
this is the greatest contribution of the NBAS to the health and wellbeing of infants and families everywhere, to the profession of
nursing, and to the other professionals who work with parents and
their young infants:

In the first 8 weeks after birth, the NBAS provides a powerful pan
disciplinary tool, with specific observations, a common language, and a

uniformity of approach for providers in supporting and observing

infants as they reveal their unique capacities, cues, and vulnerabilities;
observing and exploring the meaning of these behaviors with parents;
and supporting parent and newborn as they co-create the relationship
that will impact their lives forever.

CHAPTER 15
The Touchpoints Approach:
United States
ANN COLEMAN STADTLER anv JOHN HORNSTEIN

The Touchpoints Approach to working with families of young
children has its origin in the pediatric practice of T. Berry Brazelton.
Initially, the term Touchpoints referred to a body of specific observations about how children develop, and to less specific (but effective) ways of establishing relationships with parents. Many of these
insights are addressed in Brazelton’s earliest books including:
Infants and Mothers: Differences in Development! and Toddlers and
Parents: A Declaration of Independence.’

Brazelton’s ideas about development come from several sources,
including his direct work with the families in his practice, as well as
his collaborative research on infant capabilities. The notion central
to the Touchpoints Approach is that a child’s development is characterized by predictable periods of disorganization that occur prior
to bursts in development. This concept evolved, in large part, from
thousands of interactions with—and observations of—young children and their parents over decades of pediatric care. Discussions
about feeding concerns at 4 months, sleep problems at 7 months,
and tantrums at 2 years became data for a view of development.
This view goes beyond a simple mapping of developmental milestones to a more complex and dynamic insight into the forces that
energize a child’s progress over time. Further, this view takes into
account both the individuality each child brings to the world and
the meaning parents make of their child’s unique personhood.

Three sources of energy fuel development: the developing nervous system, the child’s internal feedback system (“I did it myself—I
can keep going”), and the external feedback system that includes
the family and greater caregiving community (“Good job—keep

159

## Page 94

160 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
going!”). All three, in combination, stimulate the child to reach his
developmental potential.

This dynamic process of development is multidimensional, with
each area of development affecting others. For example, when a
child is learning to walk, he directs his energy toward the acquisition of this new skill, and this concentration on walking has an
inhibiting effect on other areas of development. The child’s previous interest in words may wane. He now practices his new skill
during light sleep, which disturbs his sleep. Eating becomes an
unwelcome interruption to his practice of walking. This disruption
in language, eating, sleeping, and behavior is confusing to parents
and can undermine their confidence, creating what we call parental
vulnerability.

As the child gets older, the impact of development becomes less
transparent. For instance, when a child’s imagination becomes
more complex, it may have an impact on his emerging control over
toileting. A parent may not see the child’s new level of complex
thinking as it relates to toileting, but merely the fact that the child is
now having accidents, or has lost interest in toileting (Figure 15.1).

Since all development occurs within caregiving relationships,
the extent to which the system supports these relationships has
a direct impact on the child’s developmental potential. The periods of disorganization that accompany developmental progress
(Touchpoints) have an impact on the parent’s sense of self as a parent and create parental vulnerability. Each of these Touchpoints

## Page 95

The Touchpoints Approach: United States 161
offers the professional working with parents an opportunity to
support the parent’s self-esteem and, ultimately, the parent-child
relationship.

The idea that a child’s development progresses through stable
and tumultuous periods is not entirely new. Piaget,? Freud,* and
Erickson, along with countless other clinicians and researchers,
have described such discontinuity. What the Touchpoints Approach
adds to this understanding is to tie these periods specifically to the
day-to-day child-rearing challenges experienced by parents. In
doing so, Touchpoints offers professionals additional tools that
they can use to establish authentic alliances with parents. According to this model, parents experience parallel disorganization when
confronting disorganization in their child’s progress and behavior.

Concurrent with the emergence of these understandings from
direct practice with families was the creation of the Neonatal
Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). In the Touchpoints Approach,
along with the notion that disorganization is characteristic of a
child’s development is the notion that each child brings a unique
set of capabilities to his interactions with the world. Further, in eliciting those capacities using the NBAS or the Newborn Behavioral
Observations (NBO) system, professionals can utilize specific and
carefully guided observations to help parents understand their
baby and their baby’s capabilities. In describing the relationship of
the NBAS to the Touchpoints Approach, we often say that the newborn Touchpoint is the prototypical Touchpoint. It is the time of
greatest vulnerability, as well as the time of greatest opportunity.
Parents of newborns are receptive to—and in need of—support.
Using the language of the child’s behavior via the newborn assessment, we come to know the child and the new family, and they
come to know us as part of the available helping community.

The NBAS offers us an organized approach to describing the
child and sharing our observations with the parents. By observing
the newborn in the parents’ presence, describing the child’s behaviors, and observing and listening to the parents’ meaning-making
of the behavior, we come to know the parents and support their
sense of confidence in their ability to parent their baby. In supporting parental competence, forming a relationship with the parents,
and conversing with them about child-rearing challenges, we
return to observation of the child as the means through which
we join the system of care around that child.

The birth of Touchpoints as an articulated professional approach
to working with families occurred when Brazelton and a group of
researchers and clinicians at the Children’s Hospital in Boston took

this understanding about development and considered how to use
it in supporting parent-child relationships and parental mastery. In
her description of expert practice, Benner® describes expert practitioners in any discipline as those who seem to do their work automatically and invent language for how they do this work. Experts
are able to create their own guidelines for how they do their work,
but they do not always articulate these guidelines to others. As a
group, and through simulated practitioner-parent-child interactions, we extricated the principles and assumptions of Touchpoints
practice. We have used the annotated transcript of a year-long roleplay, The Shelly Manual,’ in our training program. We have encouraged others to use role-play to practice and grow in the Touchpoints
principles and to better understand what they bring to their interactions with families.

Central to the extracted principles, again, is the concept of using
the behavior of the child as one’s language. When encountering parents in practice, the currency of communication with them
is what the professional observes in the child. Describing the
child’s behavior as it happens, predicting where it might go, discussing how to manage it, understanding what it means to the
parent—all these points are part of the larger conversation that
exists within the professional-parent partnership. At the newborn
Touchpoint, the NBAS provides us with a comprehensive, wellresearched lexicon of behavior in facilitating this conversation.

Using the language of the child’s behavior is one of eight
principles that serve as a framework for training in the Touchpoints
Approach:

Touchpoints Principles

1. Value and understand the relationship between you and the

parent.

2. Use the behavior of the child as your language.

3. Recognize what you bring to the interaction.

4. Be willing to discuss matters that go beyond your traditional

role.

5. Value passion wherever you find it.

6. Focus on the parent-child relationship.

7. Look for opportunity to support parental mastery.

8. Value disorganization and vulnerability as an opportunity.

Touchpoints training utilizes these principles, along with specific
themes of development at particular ages, to help professionals

## Page 97

The Touchpoints Approach: United States 163
retool how they interact with families. Practitioners can use each of
these principles to guide and reflect on their work with families.
For example, “Value passion wherever you find it.” Passion is the
energy that an individual brings to the parenting role, and it leads
us to what is important to that parent. The principle of valuing passion offers strategies for understanding and joining a parent in
what is important to the parent. Useful to this understanding are
the parental themes described at each Touchpoint:

Parental Themes

Pregnancy: The “ideal” baby, the “damaged” baby, and the
prospects of being a parent

Newborn: The real baby and the reality of this baby’s presence

3 Weeks: The exhaustion of childbirth and newborn care

6 Weeks: Relationships within the new family and altered relationships with others

4 Months: The baby’s interest in the outside world

7 Months: The need to establish a parental style

9 Months: The baby’s ability to make his needs known (pointing,
saying, calling)

12 Months: The need for vigilance as the toddler learns to walk...
and run

15 Months: Interpreting signals that switch from clinginess to
independence

18 Months: The impact of the child’s battles for control

24 Months: Making sense of the child’s rituals and rigidity

36 Months: Coping with the 3-year-old’s complex thinking

The professional uses knowledge of these common themes and
an observation of the parent’s emotional shifts (both positive
and negative) to come to know the meaning of the child’s behavior /
development for the parent.

A key concept of the Touchpoints Approach is anticipatory guidance—guidance that is not prescriptive, but rather collaborative
(Figure 15.2). The goal is to build a supportive structure (a “scaffold”) that will keep the parent and the parent-child relationship
strong through periods of vulnerability. In this process of scaffolding, professionals and parents have equal power and engage in discussions that value the expertise of each.

Anticipatory guidance can facilitate a knowledgeable parental
response. For example, at 9 months, the infant begins to understand
permanence; in response, it is typical for parental issues related to

separation and loss to emerge. How we come to understand a
particular parent’s perspective on these issues is based on our
understanding of that parent. As we reflect on the parent’s prior
experience with separation and loss, we can anticipate her reaction
to the coming period of vulnerability. We can recall her reaction at
4 months (when the child’s interest in the outside world typically
triggers a sense of loss and separation for a parent) and apply that
reaction to the present disruption when once again the parent will
be dealing with these issues. By using a description of the child’s
behavior, we allow the parent, through her reflection on the
observed behavior, to reveal her understanding of her child and
the impact of her child’s behavior on herself. In supporting the parent’s reflection on past and present successes, past and present
dilemmas, and future dilemmas, we enhance the parent’s trust in
herself and her ability to cope with the issue successfully.

By using information from the parent and family’s past adaptations to disruptions (Touchpoints), we learn how we might help in
problem-solving the present dilemma. We set the stage for a working collaboration by supporting the parent’s competence and
demonstrating the system’s availability to collaborate and help
parents.

With the map of Touchpoints as a guide, we can anticipate the
next Touchpoint and its associated predictable disorganization. In
doing so we can collaboratively problem-solve with the parent in a
strength-based manner in order to support the parent’s emerging

sense of competence. Building on the successful navigation of each
of these Touchpoints, we promote successful parenting:

2 Years Getting to “No!”

There are at least 12 opportunities in the first 3 years for medical
providers to support parents through vulnerable times, or to provide anticipatory guidance regarding upcoming Touchpoints. In
child-care and early education, there are daily opportunities for
care providers to join parental vulnerability. Other professionals
have varying amounts of opportunity to join in also.

In 1995, we piloted training and mentorship in the Touchpoints
Approach with nine nurse practitioners and pediatricians. These
highly experienced clinicians from the Boston area played a major
role in the design of the professional development program still in
use today. At first, these providers told us they did not have time to
focus on their relationships with families because the issues within
the families they cared for were so complex that as providers they
could focus only on survival issues. By the end of the training,
however, they reported that they did not have time not to focus on
their relationships with the families. They also reported that they
did not realize how close they were to burnout, and how often
they distanced themselves from their families because they were
depleted by the problems these families faced.

Since the initial pilot, we have trained, mentored, and collaborated with multidisciplinary professionals throughout the country.
Some have focused on their individual practices with families,

## Page 100

166 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

while others—participating on a training team—have focused on
developing a seamless multidisciplinary system of care for a
particular population of families. These Touchpoints teams, in turn,
train, mentor, and change the system of care for the families in
their communities and are part of the Touchpoints National Site
Network.

The training itself contains both didactic and experiential
components. Presentations include an overview of the approach,
descriptions of specific Touchpoints with a dual focus on the child’s
development and the related parental issues, as well as anticipatory guidance and additional relevant information. Role-play and
other activities in which participants practice using elements of
the Touchpoints Approach are essential. Issues of cultural and
economic diversity are proactively addressed. The Touchpoints
Approach, by definition, is sensitive to unique, culturally formed
parental interpretations of children’s development. Demonstration
visits, including a newborn exam, are used to explore how the
approach can be applied in various settings. We see the trainings
themselves as opportunities to support reflective practice, as well
as collaborative relationships among practitioners that parallel
direct work with families.

There are now over 70 Touchpoints Sites in the Touchpoints
National Site Network. The goal of the network is to build a web of
sites across the country that share a common vision of strengthening
communities, strengthening families, and supporting the optimal
growth and development of children. Sites include organizations,
programs such as WIC and Healthy Families, agencies, hospitals,
universities, towns, counties, and even states.

Each of these sites integrates the common Touchpoints Approach
into its existing work. Touchpoints is not a stand-alone program.
Therefore, each site looks quite different. Most training teams are
multidisciplinary, composed of members from health care, child
care/early education, and social service agencies. More recently,
several training teams have been entirely composed of early childhood educators.

The Touchpoints Approach was originally adapted from medical practice and there is no question that it enhances medical
practice. Within the realm of medicine, trainers work in a diversity
of settings—from public health departments to hospitals, clinics,
and private practice. Not surprisingly, nurses have played a large
role in these various settings, often as site coordinators. In fact, several hospitals have trained their entire nursing departments and
consider attitudes that are compatible with the Touchpoints

## Page 102

Approach in their hiring decisions, core competency requirements,
and performance reviews.

Many teams focus on a city or county’s effort to provide effective, comprehensive care for its families. Three goals for local systems of care are that professionals within the community use a
common language, engage in multidisciplinary collaboration, and
promote each family’s feeling that they have power within a system of care that is responsive to their needs.

Several sites are university-based and are integrating the Touchpoints Approach into the preservice training of professionals who
work with families. The challenges for emergent professionals are
multifold. The material is new, and supervision is, by necessity,
highly directive. Students tend to focus on learning the technical
aspects of care, rather than on forming relationships with families.
The integration of a Touchpoints Approach, which emphasizes collaborative, sensitive, strength-based care presents an additional
challenge when the learner is engaged in simultaneously acquiring
the entire body of working knowledge necessary for the practice of
a particular discipline.

Child-care and early education professionals see the Touchpoints
Approach as very useful. However, unlike many health-care professionals, these early care providers have longstanding, ongoing
relationships with children. Hence, the dynamics of their relationships with children and families are uniquely different than those
of other providers. A child care/early education working group
was established to explore these issues and suggest ways to train
and mentor these professionals. This group, in collaboration with
the site network, modified the training program to be sensitive
to the unique role of child-care and early education professionals.
A central theme of this training is that early care providers need to
join the family system, rather than expecting children to join the
existing early care system. Issues such as gate-keeping between
parents and professionals (e.g., competitive feelings of affection for
the child) and establishing working relationships with parents are
essential topics. We review all of the issues that are important in
understanding the relationship between the family and the providers, and we integrate these issues into the training of child-care and
early education professionals.

Two years ago Touchpoints launched an American Indian/
Alaskan Native (AI/AN) Initiative. A goal in these communities
is “to optimize child development and support the social and emotional well-being of children within the family while at the same
time learning about and utilizing the unique culture and strengths

## Page 103

168 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

of AI/AN communities.”® Based on our work with American
Indians, we are expanding our understanding of the Touchpoints
principle of using the language of the child’s behavior. In our
work with families, we often gain understanding through questioning and listening. While this standard approach works well
in most situations, it is less effective when working with American
Indians and is often perceived by them as disrespectful. However,
“using the language of the child’s behavior” with these families
is both respectful and fruitful. Through conversations that focus
on shared observations, the provider comes to understand the
parents’ perspective, motivations, and culture. Reflective practice
and reflective supervision through journaling is working in
mentoring and supporting AI/AN Early Head Start/Head Start
teachers as they strive to understand their interactions with
parents. This process helps providers gain valuable insights
into the relationships between themselves and the parents they
serve.

Many sites are effectively utilizing the Touchpoints Approach in
various parent groups. In these groups, the role of the Touchpoints
facilitator is to join parents rather than lead them. The parents’
agenda inevitably emerges in response to the facilitator’s use of the
Touchpoints principles in guiding the group discussions. For
example, in our work with families with asthma, a curriculum
for parallel parent-and-child groups has been developed. The goal
is to empower both the child and the parent in the management of
the child’s asthma. Recently, a parent who talked about her child’s
medication at the first group session told us at week 3 that she was
not giving her child necessary medicine on a daily basis. She said
she was afraid her child would become dependent. Through the
strength-based collaboration within the group, she was able to
reveal the meaning of having her child on daily medication. We
came to know her perspective, and she, in turn, was more open to
understanding the purpose of daily medication. At the same time,
her child developed a better understanding of her asthma, the
medications she was taking, and the importance of the medication
in the control of her asthma symptoms.

We have also developed a parallel parent-child group curriculum for delayed toilet training called “toilet school.” Toilet school
is a 6-week, 1-hour-per-week program for children over 4 who are
not toilet trained. Both the child group and the parent group share
their perspectives on where they are in the process of toilet training
and the impact of the delay on their lives. Through a carefully

## Page 104

The Touchpoints Approach: United States 169
designed step-by-step approach, both parents and children are
empowered to find solutions to the dilemma.

In both chronic illness and delayed developmental skill attainment, it is easy to imagine how the parent-child relationship can be
derailed. When this happens, a much more expensive intervention
may be necessary. One goal of the Touchpoints Approach is to prevent these derailments by anticipating them.

For families who are exposed to professionals from a variety of
disciplines, major issues are the complexity of the system and lack of
collaboration. In general, most professionals miss the opportunity
for multidisciplinary collaboration in the service of families. One reason is that they have a limited awareness of or contact with the other
professionals working with the same family, and so the opportunity
to build a seamless scaffolding of support simply doesn’t exist.

CONCLUSION
The Touchpoints Approach has developed into a national training
and mentorship program that aims to support providers and
communities in changing the system of care for families. The paradigm shift at the center of this approach requires providers to focus
on strengths rather than problems, to value parental expertise
as essential in developing an understanding of the child and
family’s needs, to provide anticipatory guidance where the
parent feels joined rather than instructed, and to strive for multidisciplinary collaboration in order to form a seamless system of
care for families.

CHAPTER 16
The Newborn as a
Touchpoint: Training
Pediatricians in Portugal
JOAO GOMES-PEDRO
The sense of belonging and the quest for coherence are the forces
that shape an individual's destiny, especially in light of the changes
in family life today. As a pediatrician, clinician, and educator,
I would like to share my efforts to better understand the origins
and the development of this quest. In this chapter, I describe some
of the results of our research. My hope is that, together, we may
exchange ideas that will contribute to a greater understanding of
the importance of research on infant development.

Today, we possess a tremendous amount of knowledge about
the infant, especially compared to the knowledge we had little
more than half a century ago. In the 1920s, behavioral research concerning children below school age appeared for the first time. Up
until then, very little was known about this age group. In the 1930s,
adolescence became another focus of interest, as adults began to
express concern about all the risks so prevalent during this short
period of a young person’s life. It was not until the 1940s that
infancy came to the forefront as an area of interest for researchers
and clinicians. As professionals in different fields sought more
scientific knowledge about infants and how they changed during
infancy, behavior and development became a “must” in university
curricula all over the world.

The important influence of mothers on children had long been
recognized, and as a result, maternal behavior became a major
subject of research. After the 1950s, the child-rearing practices of
mothers became the focus of empirical research for the first time.

172 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

Soon scholars “discovered” that there was also a father in the home
who, both directly and indirectly, influenced the baby’s behavior and development. And so, the topic of parent-child interaction
and the variables influencing parent behavior became research
priorities.

In fact, the very first studies on infant behavior changed the
direction and meaning of modern research in our field. The new
view of the infant comes, very significantly, from our awareness of
the infant’s social and transactional role. Recent research about
fetal behavior shows us that babies are social even before birth.
Knowing this, it is no longer possible to view them simply as passive recipients of parental caregiving.

Human babies are genetically endowed with capacities that
ensure their survival, so they are able to respond adequately to
sensory and social stimuli. From birth, they are capable of complex
integrative behavior; and with each passing minute, hour, and day,
they become progressively competent as interactive partners and
are able to influence the way their environment will affect them. In
order to be accepted as a unique social partner, the human baby
uses her behavior as a primary mode of communication, particularly with her parents. Recognizing the significance of infant behavior, parents, clinicians, and educators all understand that reading
and interpreting babies’ communication signals is a fundamental
challenge, so sharing these discoveries has become a priority for
researchers and clinicians alike.

Neuroscience has given us evidence about how the infant organizes her emotions in order to build her feelings and, ultimately, her
consciousness. However, I am committed to learning more about
how we can help the infant build her sense of values, that is, her
moral sense. Today, Portugal is experiencing problems of child
abuse and neglect, which manifest themselves differently in different regions of the country. In fact, the indicators of family turmoil
and dysfunction in Portugal are one of the highest in Europe. The
Portuguese crude divorce rate is about 2.7 per thousand, with
the majority of divorces occurring in the first years of marriage.
This means that here—in a country which is a historic model of
maritime adventure and courage, with traditional customs that
value stability, loyalty, and faithfulness—vulnerability is emerging
in the very places where respect, passion, and commitment should
be firmly rooted—the family.

When it comes to infant mortality, Portugal is a model in Europe
with an infant mortality rate of only 3.3 per thousand. However,
infant mortality is no longer the only indicator by which we assess

health in a country. We need to also look at the rates of school
failure, teenage pregnancy, drug abuse, maternal depression,
ADHD, the emotional resilience of youth and families, and the
prevalence of family dysfunction. Furthermore, our pediatric
residents are still influenced by a pathological model of teaching /
learning medicine and are, therefore, not trained to understand and
interpret child behavior. This means they would probably be unable to recognize the distinctly different behavioral patterns of two
newborns, one of whom was born to a heroin-dependent mother,
and therefore, the practitioner would be unlikely to take steps to
adequately intervene on behalf of the more vulnerable baby.

Using findings based on the assessment of residents’ comments
on a 3-minute film of the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale
(NBAS) administered to two newborns (one normal and the other
with a deprivation syndrome), we saw that aspects of behavior like
alertness, control of states, consolability, and self-calming, as well
as manifestations of physical conditions, like tremors and color
changes, were not reported by the residents. Not surprisingly, the
more subjective reactions, such as “vulnerability” or “resilience”
were also not mentioned in the residents’ comments. We concluded,
therefore, that our residents still lack discriminative ability in terms
of the neurobehavioral assessment of the newborn, particularly
those aspects of behavior related to the organizational abilities that
indicate stress control, alertness, and interactive communication.

I am increasingly convinced that the evolution of moral development depends on the dynamic acquisition of emotions that
build character. From sympathy to empathy, moral sense emerges
based on the initial trust acquired when first attachments are
formed and fulfilled. Nature has provided for the acquisition of
these essential emotions through the trust that is inherent in a
healthy mother-infant relationship. In its first days and weeks of
life, a baby needs to experience acceptance, nurturance, respect,
and empathy. If this is the reality, then the baby views herself as
worthy of love as she becomes a child and later an adult. In contrast, babies who experience rejection, overstimulation, or unpredictability in terms of their parent’s responsivity, will be more likely
to view themselves as unworthy of love, and then it will be more
difficult for them to become good caregivers themselves.

The cycle of respect and coherence experienced by the baby as
responsive care, consistently and reliably provided, is the main
source of energy for development. However, it is not only the early
relationship between mother and child that will influence later
development, but rather how the mother and child “read” the

coherence that is the essence of good communication. The spiderweb model may explain how interpersonal relationships are
spawned from early experiences. The spider builds its web in a
progressive and consistent way. The central structure of the web is
organized at the base of the principal threads, through which the
spider intertwines other secondary threads that provide elasticity,
lightness, and resistance. In the same way, babies build relationships with other family members and an ever-widening circle of
additional people, based on the success of their relationships with
their primary caregivers.

All babies are inherently good and sympathetic and are predisposed to seek from the environment this same goodness and
sympathy. This helps the parents, especially the mother, to build an
image of “the imaginary baby” during pregnancy. The crying
baby, the baby with feeding difficulties, the baby with sleeping
difficulties—all of these babies betray the parents’ expectations,
and thus parental disappointment is sometimes the reason for a
maladjustment in the organization of first attachments. Such an
unfortunate consequence demands special attention on the part of
the pediatrician and other care providers, as well as those who
educate them.

Each baby’s first relationship is built on an initial feeling of
trust—an original state of grace—that is the state of mutual sympathy between mother and baby. Subsequent relationships are all
built on, and follow, this initial pattern. Our moral feelings originate in our most primitive social interactions based on our emotions.
Our emotions, in turn, are the source of greater or lesser empathy,
and our ability to empathize is a key influence in all of our
relationships.

Social morality is profoundly determined by individual morality, and the origins of individual morality can be found within each
baby, through the use of the NBAS.' The NBAS represents, essentially, a philosophy through which one discovers a person—the
baby—with all her abilities and individual strengths, as well as
vulnerabilities. These strengths and vulnerabilities, as a whole, are
the basis of her temperament and present a reliable behavioral
profile, which can inspire the attitudes through which the parents
teach their child about life.

In administering the NBAS, the examiner works to get the baby’s
“best performance.” In other words, through his or her sensitive
handling and clinical expertise, the examiner tries to elicit the full
range of the baby’s behavioral repertoire, to see what this particular
baby is programmed by nature to do and to learn and what parents

## Page 110

The Newborn as a Touchpoint: Training Pediatricians in Portugal 175
can most effectively do in an attempt to help her organize her
responses. The careful observer may, through the NBAS, discover
the baby as a person. This process of discovery represents the best
fundamental use of the NBAS as an intervention tool, particularly
where vulnerability is the case.

During the assessment, a full dynamic evaluation of the baby’s
abilities is roughly sketched, based on positive social stimulation
quite similar to that which is likely to be provided by the baby’s
own parents in their daily routines. We travel with the baby from
stage to stage, from sleep to crying, trying to reach the summit of
the journey, when the baby, in a full state of alertness, interacts and
plays with us. When we obtain a prolonged state of alertness and a
contingent interaction, it is then possible for the baby to imitate us
on different occasions and in different states of this affective harmony, which we call empathy. Empathy implies the alignment of
emotions and expectations, an alignment that is, after all, necessary
for the attunement of any relationship. Why? Because the fundamental basis of the relationship makes sense to both partners. The
baby is unknown to us until, using the NBAS, we mutually develop
an empathic relationship with her. This kind of relationship can
only be established by one whom the baby recognizes as being a
provider of a sense of coherence. We think it is essential for parents
to discover and share this relationship early.

When the baby is someone with whom we have already established a contingent intercompatibility of shared affects, imitation
becomes even more complex and, also, richer, because it corresponds with our already compatible states of spirit. This is the
empathy of affect, which determines the successive stages of moral
development.

I believe, more and more, that antisocial behaviors have their
origin in the inadequate development of empathy. Empathy or—to
use a “Brazeltonian” expression—passion, is what should inspire
each of our interventions at the main Touchpoints of infancy and
childhood. Our deepest concern in our clinical work is to find strategies that can strengthen babies and their families in terms of their
passion because this passion is the basis of each family’s sense of
identity. In terms of child development, identity is deeply related to
intimacy and trust—basic needs that are essential for the emergence
of self-esteem and the establishment of structural relationships.”

Today, clinicians recognize human development as a dynamic
process influenced by determining factors that are both endogenous and exogenous. These factors, functioning together through
the maturation of the central nervous system, contribute to the

## Page 111

176 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

individual’s processes of development. The goal of development is
to reach a sense of competence identified as the total realization of
humanness.

I see a parallel between identity and competence, as well as
between empathy and moral sense. In clinical terms, it is relevant that the philosophy and strategies of intervention proposed
by Brazelton attempt to highlight the flux of empathy between the
child and her parents or grandparents and between clinicians and
families. This is particularly critical when Touchpoints principles
are used as guidelines for our intervention.* Development is not,
in fact, a continuous chain of events, but rather a journey of starts
and stops.

The map of child development is predictable and serves as the
base for identifying entry points for early intervention. Before each
spurt of development—cognitive, motor, emotional, or moral—
there is a short period of regression. Parents need to understand
that these periods are part of the normal development of each child.
Each of these periods is a unique opportunity to reinforce an indispensable climate of trust between parents and professionals. This
sense of trust is the core philosophical principle of Touchpoints.

The first of these Touchpoints, planned to strengthen identity
and to reduce risks in the critical perinatal period, is the prenatal
visit that occurs in the pediatrician’s office. To be expecting a baby—
especially a first baby—is one of the most important events in a
womar/s life and clearly represents a challenge to the expectant
mother’s maturity and to the structure of her personality. It is also a
time of taking on new responsibilities. In the face of these responsibilities, the woman is—from the beginning—involved in a relationship of mutual dependence and progressive attunement. The most
dramatic changes in the lifestyle of the woman who has become
pregnant come from an awareness that she has stopped being a girl
and has begun assuming the responsibility for her baby. A sharing
of responsibility is also progressively assumed by the couple, to the
extent that both become aware that they have begun to divide time
and attention with another person—real, even if not yet present—in
their world. In very little time, a pediatrician or a family doctor is
able to enter into a significant relationship with the parents-to-be.

Health-care providers have excellent opportunities, particularly at the time of each Touchpoint, to reduce the stress of new
parenthood, facilitate the development of more secure attachments
between parents and child, and encourage development of a
child’s secure sense of identity through the passion of an empathic
intervention.

Preface

Scientists have long been fascinated by the human newborn,
intrigued by questions about the genetic origins of the infant’s
behavioral repertoire and about the deft interplay of genetic and
environmental factors in shaping the child’s behavior. Is the
newborn baby’s repertoire inescapably genetic? How do newborn
traits reach down into the double helix? Are there individual differences in behavior at birth and if so, do these individual differences
persist into later childhood? Have scientists underestimated or
overestimated the newborn infant’s capacity for learning or the
infant’s capacity for feeling? Do early experiences actually determine the child’s future cognitive and emotional well-being? How
resilient is the young infant? Are cultural differences in behavior
evident from the beginning? How effective are intervention strategies that begin in the newborn period? What are the implications
of our new understanding of newborn behavior and development
for parents around the world? These are the kinds of questions
that have engaged neuroscientists for at least three decades and this
volume constitutes an attempt by researchers from around the world
to address many of them.

In this book we present the findings of a group of researchers
and theoreticians from different countries, all of whom share a
common interest in newborn behavior and development, and all of
whom seem to be driven by a passionate commitment to give children and their families the best possible start in life. Despite considerable diversity in theoretical perspective and research interest,
all of these authors believe that the newborn infant is a competent
and complex organism and have concluded that the newborn
period is a formative period in the child’s development and in
the development of the parent-child relationship, while many believe
that the newborn period and the early months of life may well
be the intervention point par excellence across the human life span.

The book begins with a brief look back at the history of newborn
research and describes what we have learned about newborn behavior and early relationships over the past 3 decades. The main
body of the book goes on to present a series of research and clinical

The Newborn as a Touchpoint: Training Pediatricians in Portugal 177

In Portugal, as in many other countries, some important positive
patterns of child care face the risk of being discarded as cultural
standards. One of these patterns is for mothers to continue breastfeeding their babies throughout the first months. (With almost a
full 100% of mothers breastfeeding at birth, we found that only
18% were still breastfeeding at 4 months.) Another pattern is for
fathers to be present at health visits; unfortunately, anecdotal
evidence indicates that their attendance has been dropping off
considerably.

Yet, it has been possible to reverse these disappointing trends.
Tracking these two patterns of parental behavior in a middle-class
Portuguese sample, we observed significant changes with new parents who had both attended 15- to 20-minute interviews with their
pediatricians while they were still parents-to-be, compared with
new parents who did not attend such prenatal pediatric visits.*
Examining the rate of breastfeeding, 74% of the mothers who had
come to the prenatal visit were still breastfeeding their babies at 4
months (a sharp contrast to the 18% in the control group). Similarly, 76% of the fathers who had participated in the prenatal visit
came to at least four of their babies’ routine visits during the first
year of the infant’s life. Only 23% of the fathers in the control group
did the same.

Very probably, passion was the secret to these changes. In fact, it
is the passion that comes from our own empathy that inspires us,
as practitioners, to intervene in these crucial Touchpoints in the
lives of young families.

There is no question that the structure of the family is changing
very rapidly in Western cultures. The traditional nuclear twoparent family is disappearing, and this fact has to inspire new strategies in our interventions. Today single-parent families are
prevalent in Portugal. There are also many couples who, while not
divorcing, are experiencing severe stress related to dysfunction in
their marriages. In addition, many parents feel poorly prepared,
and their behavior, when responding to the needs of their sons and
daughters, reflects their lack of confidence and lack of skill. In short,
much of their behavior reflects the stress that society has placed on
them in their parenting roles.

In Portugal, more and more parents and children are faced with
the abrupt separation that occurs when a baby is handed over to a
day care system where the baby will remain from morning until
night. Approximately 80% of women in the reproductive age group
work. Within this group, about 65% who have a child under
10 years are employed, with only 10% of these having part-time

jobs. This figure represents the second highest level of working
mothers of young children in the European Union, and it should
lead to a completely different policy concerning educational and
child-care services in Portugal.

Bronfenbrenner and his colleagues wrote that what we need is a
“humanism of science” to address all these realities, particularly in
the early periods of life when children are most vulnerable.°? Vulnerability, in this context, does not imply inevitable fatality. Rather,
it means distress, discouragement, and despair. What we have to
do is change despair into hope. In Portugal, we have been working
on this transformation since the 1970s, very much influenced by
the passionate principles articulated by Berry Brazelton. We are
aware of the voids that have been created by new habits—habits
that, in anthropological terms, are destroying societal foundations that have existed for centuries. One of these foundations
is the stable arrangement of the mother and baby together, without
a break, following birth.

About 20 years ago, we became convinced that the separation of
mother and baby in our maternity wards after delivery was a determining factor in increasing vulnerability in the early postpartum
period. Using identical rooming-in conditions, we studied the
influence of extended early contact on both newborn infants’ and
their mothers’ behavior. This experimental “postpartum contact”
group was compared to a control group of infants and mothers
who were separated immediately after birth in the way that was
traditional then—with the baby kept in a newborn nursery except
for brief stays in the mother’s room for feeding or the father’s visit.
One of the main findings of our study was that interactive items of
Orientation, which assess the baby’s social interactive capacities on
the NBAS, were significantly better for the postpartum contact
group.’ As for the mothers’ behavior, it was meaningful that
the group with early contact got better results in the Affectionate
Behavior items.

Birth is a primary Touchpoint for clinicians working with new
parents, providing a unique opportunity for inspiring empathy
and coherence. Over the past 2 decades, an increasing body of
research has emerged stressing early childhood as a primary period
for interventions. In Portugal, in another study, we examined
whether a change in parents’ attitudes would influence subsequent
parent-infant interactions. While one control group of mothers,
on the third day of their babies’ lives, had a 7-minute talk about
routine issues of infant health, one experimental group underwent
a structural intervention, also about 7 minutes in duration, which

The Newborn as a Touchpoint: Training Pediatricians in Portugal 179
was inspired by the Brazelton model. The same pediatrician told
mothers in the experimental group, “We have been observing
your baby so as to get to know her, as well as her abilities. We
would like you to observe and experience some of your baby’s
abilities, too. Have you noticed that she can see and hear?” At this
point, the NBAS items of Animated Visual and Auditory Sensory
Orientation were demonstrated. Then, each mother was invited to
elicit the responses from her baby. She was reinforced by being told
that she, the infant’s mother, had elicited her infant’s best performance. The pediatrician then spoke about the baby’s good reflexes
and elicited the Moro reflex. He then demonstrated the infant’s
response to being consoled, through the NBAS Consolability item.
The mother was invited to talk to the baby and taught how to console her child. In this way, the mother became aware of both her
baby’s ability to recover from stress and her own ability to promote
this recovery. Finally, the mother was asked to hold her baby
after the pediatrician had first demonstrated the newborn’s cuddliness. The last part of the intervention consisted of a short dialogue
with the mother about the observed competencies of the neonate as
well as her role as the baby’s partner.

Although Sensory Orientation, Consolability, and Cuddliness
are all common behaviors, these were the three NBAS items chosen
for this intervention because Portuguese mothers of low and middle socioeconomic status are generally not aware of them. Our
results support the view that mothers become aware of their newborns’ behavioral competencies when an appropriate intervention
is designed with this purpose in mind.’

Using the NBAS as an assessment instrument, we observed that
the infants in the experimental group were more responsive to
visual and auditory stimuli, as measured by the NBAS Orientation
cluster. This group also had a more favorable interactive pattern as
measured through a specific interactive assessment—the “stillface” procedure—which was repeated nine times during the first
two years of the babies’ lives. Noticeable differences between the
two groups were highlighted when we began using the “still-face”*
procedure at 12 months. By the time the babies were 6 years old,
*The “still-face” is a well-known procedure designed by Tronick and Brazelton to study the infant’s response to a stressful event by making eye contact
and interacting with the baby and then presenting the baby with a stony,
unmoving, unspeaking, inexpressive face; infants’ differing reactions can be
indicators of eventual behavioral differences.

180 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

however, no differences were evident between the groups. This
result suggests the hypothesis that the follow-up itself may have
acted as a significant intervention for both groups by unintentionally combining them into a single intervention sample.

From research of this kind, we are learning to better predict
developmental outcomes, a responsibility that should be imperative for clinicians in their everyday practices. Belief in this
imperative guides us in our practice, and that is why we intervene
at every one of the Touchpoints suggested in Brazelton’s
Touchpoints Approach.

The impact of the Touchpoints Approach was suggested to us
when, at the 9-year follow-up, mothers from the experimental
group were better able to recall what the pediatrician had talked
about with them when initially sharing the discovery of their newborn babies—9 years previously.

We already know through well-documented evidence that each
individual is affected not only by his experiences, but even more so
by the way he feels events or behaviors ought to be. We believe that
this perception of the rightness of a situation underlies the development of moral sense in each culture. In addition, we learn from
Ortega Y. Gasset that each person is a combination of his or her
own unique selfhood. Each child’s development is shaped first of
all by the family, and then by its extensions—by the child’s other
relatives, friends, neighbors, teachers, and even pets. Brazelton’s
view of Touchpoints is very much based on the constructs of circumstance and change, which make it much easier to develop comprehensive strategies for clinical intervention.

The circumstances or the environment in which the child lives,
however, is not a stable factor. This is particularly true when
there is a disturbance in relationships. We provoked this disturbance experimentally using the still-face paradigm at different
ages. We could see that the inexpressive, emotionless face caused
extreme distress to the baby in the newborn period. We could
see the same emotional catastrophe in the child’s reactions at
12 months. But even more impressive than the child’s distress was
the adaptive effort of the baby to reestablish the balance—that
is, the child’s efforts to recover the sense of coherence that was lost
through this experimentally induced disturbance, namely by
crying, closing her eyes, looking away, or going to sleep. In observing the still-face situation, we recognize the frustration of a baby
whose major expectation is to be able to be engaged in affective
exchanges with someone very special to her. Every baby is

## Page 118

The Newborn as a Touchpoint: Training Pediatricians in Portugal 181
“programmed” to be loved, to feel that she belongs, and to have a
sense of coherence in whatever happens to her. If a child builds a
strong self-image because all these programmed expectations are
fulfilled, then she is able to be empathic and altruistic, and able to
believe in others. Following the logic of this basic observation, the
development of moral sense and the prevention of violence in our
society begins here.

Bearing all this in mind, what are we doing in Portugal? We are
using the Touchpoints Approach in our clinical work. We are using
the NBAS as an opportunity for early intervention with families,
particularly with families at risk. At our university hospital, we have
begun to use the prenatal Touchpoint with parents at risk. Before
each mother’s maternity discharge, we share the discovery of neonatal behavior with both parents. Overall, we attempt to invest, primarily, in education. We meet every week to plan Touchpoints
interventions. We practice Touchpoints together, once a month. We
teach Touchpoints once a year through a 1-week course given by a
multidisciplinary team. We teach the NBAS to researchers and the
Newborn Behavioral Observations (NBO) system to clinicians.*

We teach our young neonatologists Touchpoints and NBAS
through an intensive postgraduate course. In the first year of our
medical curricula, we teach our students neurobehavior and
development, and they have the opportunity to visit nurseries,
kindergartens, old-age homes, prisons, and centers for handicapped children. In their pediatric curriculum, our students follow
a family through pregnancy, the delivery, and the first health visit.
They evaluate what happens during this first follow-up visit in
terms of neurodevelopment and prevention.

On the whole, we teach Touchpoints and the NBAS as models
for intervention; we teach early intervention; and we teach the cycle
of moral sense—sympathy, communication, empathy, altruism, tolerance, and respect—as opposed to the adversity cycle, particularly
in families at risk. Our challenge now is to establish a national program for a preventive family intervention using the Touchpoints
philosophy. All this is centered in our university department and at
our medical school that is affiliated with a central hospital.

This is part of a dream. Maybe it is still only a dream. Let me
recall, however, the words of Fernando Pessoa, one of our great
Portuguese poets:

Perhaps I will take to the other world what I have dreamed, but will I be

able to take to that world what I forgot to dream??

CHAPTER 17
Humanizing the Infant:
France
DRINA CANDILIS-HUISMAN anp
MARIE FABRE-GRENET
The Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) is a powerful
tool for clinicians, researchers, and teachers—for all of us who
work with neonates and their parents. Although it is a clinical tool,
it is not only a clinical tool. It is a research tool and an intervention
tool. Why are these multiple purposes so important? The power of
the NBAS, we believe, is due to the different research, educational,
and clinical approaches advocated by T. Berry Brazelton and the
team that has worked with him to develop the NBAS and oversee
its evolution. Each professional has a different set of tasks and,
therefore, each has a different point of view. It is not only pediatricians who administer, teach, and utilize the NBAS in their work;
the NBAS is also used by psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and
others whose goal is to support parents, to focus on the baby as a
unique individual, and to work together to promote and support the
development of this individual. The NBAS, therefore, is baby-centered,

with the strong involvement of the parents.
THERAPEUTIC CONSULTATIONS IN
THE MATERNITY WARD

I (DCH) want to share with you some thoughts about the use of the
NBAS as a clinical intervention tool from a psychotherapist’s point
of view. In general, I am called on as an expert to intervene, as a
Drina Candilis-Huisman wrote the first part of the chapter, “Therapeutic Consultations in the Maternity Ward,” and Marie Fabre-Grenet wrote the second part, starting
with “Contribution of NBAS to the Practice of Neonatology.”

supplement to the routine care provided by the maternity ward
team and its usual partners. In adding my own contribution to all
of this team’s work, I come to the maternity ward with a one-time
consultation as my only chance to help. I know that, generally,
there will be no other opportunity to meet with this mother and
her infant.

As a working hypothesis, I look at the NBAS assessment as part
of a triadic situation, with three different partners: the mother; the
baby; and myself, the examiner. When I say three partners, I nevertheless want to underscore the heterogeneous positions of the three,
the examiner being external, quite separate from the initial motherchild dyad. It is the actual involvement of each of these three
partners that confers special characteristics to this examination
during the perinatal period.

The structure of the NBAS as a framework for consultation brings
an energetic impulse to this triadic schema in order to influence, in
some way, the future direction of this mother-infant relationship.

I speak from the dual viewpoint of someone who has experience
both as a child therapist and as an NBAS trainer. These two different perspectives make me particularly aware of the importance and
the strength of intervention during these first moments of an infant’s
life. In our maternity wards in France, a pregnant woman typically
meets 20 to 30 different people in, or related to, the institution of the
maternity ward during her journey from pregnancy to new motherhood. A clinician must make a very strong impression in order to
introduce something new and uniquely memorable in a woman’s
maternity ward experience. That is why Iam continuously surprised
to find that when I administer the NBAS, I remain a figure of reference
for a very long time for the family. I remember Tom, for instance,
whose father regularly sent me photographs and written notes
about his son’s developmental milestones: first smile, first steps,
first words, and so forth. And I had seen this infant just once!

Promoting the kind of triadic situation that has this kind of
positive long-term impact is the examiner’s main task. With this
goal in mind, I next discuss the examination in three different
phases, which I believe summarize the emotional dynamics of
the three partners.

EXAMINER’S POINT OF VIEW

There is always a feeling of excitement before going into a new
mother’s room. It is probably a mixture of fear and desire—fear of
being refused and the desire to be useful. (S. Stoleru'! compared this

## Page 122

Humanizing the Infant: France 185
to the struggle against the envy fantasy described by the famous
Freudian child psychoanalyst, Melanie Klein, that envisioned
stealing the baby from the mother’s womb.’*) The other aspect is
that the examiner has to gain the trust of the mother and the baby
and, finally, win over their confidence. Does this first meeting
require specific skills? At first, it might seem so, but in considering
past experiences, I am not completely sure. In France, we work in
an environment where specific guidance about parenting and
infant care is not usually provided by a psychologist, but by a rotating team of nurses, each one having a very specific point of view.
For instance, one nurse might say to a mother, “You should
breastfeed your baby.” But a few minutes later, a second nurse
might come into the room and advise the mother to feed her
baby with a bottle. Understandably, in this kind of situation,
mothers are both eager and apprehensive about receiving any advice
at all about their babies. For this reason, I am very careful about the
impact of what I tell a mother as we discover her baby together
through the NBAS. This brings us to the second partner: the
mother.

MOTHER’S POINT OF VIEW

The new mother vacillates between two different identities: an
image of herself as a baby and an image of herself as a mother. (We
are grateful to Dan and Nadia Stern for describing this special and
unique ambivalence.*) We need to empathize with both of these
two persons in one.

How does the mother first react to the prospect of participating
in the NBAS assessment? She might be worried or, on the contrary,
quite confident. If we pay attention to her attitudes—how worried
or how confident, how concerned or unconcerned she is—we will
have our first hint of what is likely to be her typical way of projecting her feelings onto her baby. A mother’s worries might indicate
that she views the baby as a personification of her own unhappy
inner world. In contrast, those very same worries could indicate
her desire to build a genuine realm of emotional protection for her
infant and for herself. I often meet this latter kind of situation with
immigrant mothers.

Unconcerned women may have very different profiles. Sometimes,
mothers are overwhelmed by all the medical requirements of the
hospital, and so they are distracted from focusing on their child’s
developmental profile. Sometimes they are hiding the emergence
of depressive feelings.

## Page 123

186 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

And what about confidence? I am very often struck by an attitude of immediate—sometimes exaggerated—confidence. This is
frequently the case with mothers who come from foster homes.
Overconfidence indicates to me that I will need a lot of time to get
these mothers to trust me; however, often, I cannot get them to trust
me in one session. It would be necessary to share two or three sessions with such a mother and her baby in order to make it possible
for her to be able and willing to observe her baby with someone
else—with me—in this case. Usually, this kind of mother is just too
emotionally fragile to allow herself to acknowledge the fragilities,
as well as the strengths, of her child. In France, mothers usually
stay in the maternity ward for only 3 days after delivery. I consider
this to be too short a time for the clinician to establish a deep, confident relationship with emotionally fragile mothers; and this kind
of confidence is necessary for us to be able to observe the baby
together in a meaningful way. It would take at least two or three
different sessions for us to be able to establish such a relationship.
And so, in response to the special needs of these kinds of
mothers, we have established an intervention program at a mother
and baby care center. Here we meet with these mothers and babies
on an ongoing basis after they leave the hospital. In this setting, we
help the mothers focus on only one aspect of their babies’ development at a time—for instance, motor organization, sleep, or orientation abilities. I think it is necessary to progress step by step with
these kinds of mothers in order to respect their lack of
self-confidence.

A situation that requires very special sensitivity is the mother
who has delivered a healthy baby after previously experiencing a
stillbirth. Normally, most mothers in this situation are defiant at
first, but extremely rewarding to work with by the end of the NBAS
session. It takes a special effort to help them get past their very
understandable fear that even though this infant has survived, it
may have some long-dreaded defect or abnormality. The difficulty
with a mother in this situation is not only to ignore her lack of
self-confidence, but also to deeply understand and validate her
feelings of guilt for having lost a previous baby. This guilt is sometimes the reason for a delay in this mother’s ability to develop an
appropriate bond with her new, healthy baby.

BABY’S POINT OF VIEW
We can consider the entire encounter as a play in three different
acts, just like a drama on a stage, with three different actors—the

xx PREFACE

studies by researchers and clinicians from countries around the world.
We present studies on the effects of various pre- and perinatal
influences on newborn behavior, from low birthweight and prematurity to intrauterine lead exposure. Longitudinal studies from
Sweden and Japan examine the important question of the relation
between newborn behavior and later development. The effects of a
range of intervention practices are reported, from infant massage
to relationship-based interventions, extending from rural settings
in Thailand to urban settings in Denmark, Britain, Australia, and
the United States, while the cultural context of infant development
is described in cultures from Korea to Kenya. There are a number
of chapters describing different approaches to professional education and resident training and efforts to implement a more positive
model of patient care in European and North American settings.
In the final section of the book, we take a look at the future and
specify the challenges facing children and families everywhere,
offering a series of proposals for intervention and public policy.
The authors address the question of how this new body of information can help researchers, clinicians, and policymakers better
understand the needs of infants and families as the twenty-first
century moves ahead.

These research reports attest to the role the Neonatal Behavioral
Assessment Scale (NBAS) has played by expanding our understanding of newborn behavior and development. When the NBAS
was first published in 1973, little was known about the remarkable
capacities of the newborn. Indeed, when I first came to the Child
Development Unit at the Children’s Hospital in Boston in the late
1970s to work with Berry Brazelton, I was not alone in thinking
that the newborn infant was passive and incompetent, little more
than a reflexive, even subcortical, organism. I was fortunate to learn
about the remarkable capacities of the newborn through the NBAS
under the mentorship of its creator T. Berry Brazelton and his colleagues. When I later became responsible for NBAS training, we
established an international network of researchers, designed to
promote the use of the NBAS in research and clinic settings around
the world. The first historic meeting of that group took place in
Berlin in 1985, and many of the participants in that meeting and
in the subsequent meetings of the international NBAS network are
key contributors to this volume.

This book, then, celebrates the extraordinary advances in our
understanding of newborn and infant development that have
emerged over the past 3 decades. These new scientific discoveries
have given the lie to the classic Lockean or Skinnerian view of the

baby and the examiner in the spotlight and then, very near but
slightly out of the limelight, the mother.

Phase I: The Beginning

All of us trained to administer the NBAS assessment know that the
ideal situation is to begin when the baby is asleep so that it’s possible to get a complete picture of the full range of her competencies.
The Habituation items are difficult to assess accurately (or must be
eliminated entirely) when the baby is alert, active, or crying. In
general, neither the mother nor the examiner really likes to wake
up a sleeping baby. It is obvious that sleep protects the infant’s
internal world. Nevertheless, when mother and examiner do have
the opportunity to administer the recommended NBAS items
during sleep, it is fascinating to observe how powerful the infant’s
ability is to resist being awakened; it’s as if, somehow, this tiny
being were convinced of the usefulness of sleep.

Phase II: The Middle

If the baby was asleep when the assessment started, she is not
asleep anymore. The question now is: Will the mother allow someone else to discover her baby with her? She could observe her infant
by herself; most mothers do. But because of the sort of “noise” that
inevitably accompanies a mother’s personal interpretation of her
infant’s behavior (projective identification), observing her infant in
the company of another person who will offer support, yet require
her to look at her baby more objectively is a novel and challenging
concept. Looking at her infant more objectively, within the first few
days of its life is anticipating the kind of observation that would
normally occur a little later during the process of establishing her
relationship with the baby.

The NBAS enables the new mother to discover two different
people: She observes her baby and discovers a new person, and she
observes herself observing the baby; in this way, she discovers
herself as a new person, too. It is necessary to firmly and tactfully
support this adventure. The process of discovery is a risky one that
needs careful attention. As facilitators, we need to help guide this
process in a way that is as unobtrusive as possible. In fact, this is a
very sophisticated job. That’s one reason we have to carefully
examine the thoroughness and sensitivity of our training.

We also have the responsibility of offering an appropriate way of
handling a newborn. Brazelton, in Saving the Bathwater, explained
his concept of “best performance” in a very interesting way: “We
believe that the best performance represents a form of pushing

## Page 126

188 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

limits which may be a better estimate of future performance than a
modal performance.”* I totally agree, with a small restriction. I think
we have to be very careful in our attempts to search for the best
performance in a baby who has a handicap or deficiency. In this
realm, especially, the issue of how—and even whether—to seek
best performance remains an open question.

Phase III: The Conclusion

Does the NBAS experience leave the mother and the examiner
feeling happy or puzzled? When we feel that we have contributed
to understanding how the baby is best able to organize herself,
even in a small way, we, as examiners, feel rewarded; and we can
feel the same sense of reward in the mother. When a mother understands how to read her baby’s cues, the baby is empowered and the
mother is, too. Their interactions are more satisfying on both sides,
and their relationship gets off to a solid start.

At this very earliest period of life, the NBAS examination has a
dual goal—both to link the mother and the baby, and to separate
them. This endeavor is not always successful. Sometimes I go out
of the room puzzled. The exam has been meaningful, of course. Yet
it is clear that this particular mother-infant dyad is going to need
further support. Sometimes it is necessary to respect the mother
and infant’s self-protective emotional need to work out the future
of their relationship for themselves. Sometimes it is more useful to
try to find a network of support for the mother. Inevitably, building
the necessary kind of network requires multidisciplinary teamwork. The resources for supporting mothers and infants vary
greatly from one country to the next. Yet even in our rich Western
countries, the means for building a powerful and effective support
network during this early period of life is woefully inadequate.

I want to emphasize that both the framework of the NBAS and
the guidelines for successfully administering the examination are
based on the hypothesis that neonatal behavior is immediately set
amid a complex relational system. René Spitz, in his book The First
Year of Life,> describes the mother-infant relationship as a “crowd of
two.” I look at this relationship as a threesome, in which the clinician retains a flexible and distinctly different role with both the
mother and the infant.

I believe that the quality of the examination depends not only on
the ability to accurately assess the infant’s capacities but also on the
dynamic relationship that emerges among the different partners.
The clinician’s effectiveness relies on his or her flexibility, an essential
quality about which we need to conduct more research.

CONTRIBUTION OF NBAS TO THE PRACTICE
OF NEONATOLOGY

When I (MFG) meet at-risk babies who have been hospitalized and
their parents, the NBAS is an important Touchpoint in follow-up
care. Since 1991, I have met many mothers (and fathers, too, but
unfortunately, fewer fathers) around their babies’ incubators. As I
follow these families during the early years of their children’s lives,
it seems to me very important to offer these parents a space for
listening around the baby.

The kind of intervention that I offer usually occurs just prior
to discharge, midway between the neonatology unit and CAMSP
(Centre d’Action Medico-Sociale Précoce, the early medicalsocial intervention center). My approach, looking at the baby as
an individual person at a particular point in development—and an
integral part of the infant-parents-caregiver system—requires a
deliberate shift to a more global kind of medicine: developmental
medicine.

CONTEXT

The tendency to hypermedicalize pregnancy is not going to slow
down—because of the increased medicalization of procreation,
which has led to more premature births; an increasing number of
multiple births; and an increasing number of late-in-life pregnancies.
Thus there is a paradox. We have succeeded in reducing the rates of
infant mortality, but we have induced new causes of prematurity
and morbidity by creating situations where shorter gestation periods
threaten viability. Thus our neonatal units are always crowded.
Medical techniques of intensive care—and neonatal survival rates—
are improving every day. We are saving babies, allowing them to live,
but we have to take a long-term look at what is going on here and
ask the question: What is the cost of this?

The organizational structure of CAMSP as an integral part of a
mother-infant hospital allows us to initiate intervention and
provide comprehensive follow-up care of at-risk infants and their
families in an ideal setting. We can start following them in the
neonatology unit, sometimes before birth in the high-risk pregnancy unit, or at birth.

Taking care of and following babies born prematurely or
hospitalized at birth (and their parents) is a long-term story. This
story begins with a pregnancy, often at risk, but sometimes not.
Often conception has been spontaneous, but sometimes it has
been induced (or in vitro). Then one day, nothing is going as

## Page 128

190 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

expected: the fruit is falling from the tree while it is still green,
and suddenly this mother is living with violence, the emergence
of danger, death, disability, and dispossession of her body—a body
that is no longer playing its role. Her uterus has become dangerous
instead of protective. The psychological process of the pregnancy
is broken: Can this mother recover and become a premature-mother?
Bruschweiler-Stern has described “the premature-mother” concept
by pointing out that a pregnancy takes 9 months in the mother’s
head, too.° When a baby is born prematurely, the mother feels that
she does not control anything and that her pregnancy has been
disposed of by the “powerful doctors” on whom her child’s survival
seems to depend; she often feels diminished by not having been
able to give birth normally.

She will have to do successive grieving. She will grieve a normal
pregnancy, a normal delivery, and an ideal newborn. Add to this
the disappointment of a baby who may look like a “shrimp”—
skinny, red, and (often in the beginning) living with the assistance
of machines in her boat-like incubator. It is all so strange to her.

All these situations raise psychological issues that will have to
be addressed in an integrated way in the course of providing the
prevention and support care that this new infant, and new family,
needs. It will require real teamwork. Different fields of thinking
orient our multidisciplinary response:

e The medical field: It’s crucial to care for various transitory
pathologies caused by immaturity, which can become chronic
and, as a result, cause real pathologies—reflux, respiratory
diseases, developmental delay, and so forth. All this can result
in a baby that is difficult to handle—a baby that resists being
held in your arms because of painful reflux, a baby who will
not look at people spontaneously. Another concern is early
medical intervention. Definitive brain lesions, for example, will
result in a very different outcome if follow-up starts as soon as
possible, even in the neonatology unit, rather than being
delayed until 4 months of corrected age—and 4 months late!

e The psychosocial field: A variety of difficult psychological and
social issues are often added to the challenges a new family
faces solely on the basis of the baby’s prematurity.

e The preventive field: This is the true mission of the CAMSP: the
prevention of relationship troubles, developmental troubles,
and postural abnormalities. The prevention of all the sequelae
caused by prematurity is the primary goal of all the caregivers
who are a part of, or who work with, the neonatology team.

Humanizing the Infant: France 191
How WE Work WITH FAMILIES
Understanding neonatal development and behavior in accordance
with the approach of Brazelton and his colleagues, like Als, has
proven really meaningful for us in the care and the following of
premature babies. The spirit of this approach is to challenge
our preconceived notions and push us to question our habitual
ways of thinking and acting. It can often be uncomfortable but, at
the same time, it is very enriching.

Spending time with newborns and observing their behavior
leads us to touch the never-ending richness of human behavior.
The possibility of following their progress for the long term allows
a real support of parents, but perhaps of caregivers, too, for they
also experience the rewards of their investment. In this way, the
babies are supporting us just as we are supporting them.

Up until now, the predominant medical model has been a pathological one; but the time has come to expand both our point of view
and our diagnostic tools as we consider the “normal” model of child
health in the context of developmental issues.

The observation of the behavior of the neonate that Brazelton
formalized in the NBAS has led us to focus on the baby as an individual. Understanding the baby’s language by observing and interpreting her reactions allows us to adapt her environment, including
interactions with her caregivers. That means the people who take
care of the infant—parents, the mother in particular, and the
medical staff—make deliberate adjustments in the way they
interact with her; it also means making adjustments to her physical
environment—light and noise levels, and even the selection of
accessories and equipment used in her care.

It is enriching to observe how adapting the environment to each
baby helps her to structure and develop herself. But in reverse, an
unadapted environment—for example, one that is too intrusive,
too stimulating or not stimulating enough, or for too long or too
short a period of time—is going to disturb her development or have
no positive effect. When stimulation is adjusted to what the baby
seems to need and want, it really helps and supports her. Throughout the administration of the scale, we can see the baby awakening,
organizing herself, controlling her physiology, and becoming
stronger. I never observe bradycardiae or decrease of oxygen level
during the administration of the NBAS with fragile babies.

The challenge is for us to open our eyes, identify the relationship
between the stress reactions of every baby and her environment,
and figure out how to modify the environment to support the development of each infant. Sharing our observations with the parents

## Page 130

192 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
allows them to be partners in the care of their baby; they become
familiar with her universe.

Considering the baby as a full partner, we are able to take advantage of all her resources and interpret her reactions. During the assessment, the baby will “lead the game” by participating or withdrawing
in accordance with her capabilities and her unique individuality.
Sometimes she is withdrawn, and it is up to the examiner to adapt
the stimulation of the exam, decreasing the intensity, giving her a
little break, or interrupting the administration of the scale if continuing becomes inopportune. Flexibility is the master word to us:
Flexibility means changing our understanding, as “best performance” tends to achieve surprising outcomes when compared to a
classical examination. This is particularly evident in the pull-to-sit
item; during a normal neurological examination, we are obtaining
a reflection of the basic axial tone. During the NBAS, it seems to be
the will of the baby to display a superior brain function. For example, when the baby has a brain impairment (most typically, bleeding), we expect to see a floppy baby, then suddenly she contracts
her muscles, holds her head in midline, and looks at you for a
while; this stabilization and deliberate gaze seems to be accomplished through sheer force of will.

Scoring the NBAS enables us to get a better sense of perspective
and look at the baby more objectively; the NBAS encourages us to
analyze the baby’s behaviors. What we learn will complete our
medical analysis and also guide us in the care of this baby.

Wuat WE Do

Before discharge (sometimes even before delivery), the midwife
meets mothers in the high-risk pregnancy unit or in the maternity
ward. She asks questions about the pregnancy, provides information
about what to expect postpartum, and serves as the mother’s liaison
to our team. Whenever possible, I try to meet parents and their
babies around the NBAS when the baby is off life supports and is
ready, or nearly ready, for discharge. Sometimes we have met before,
in an informal way around the incubator or in the corridor; perhaps
we have been introduced by the psychologist or one of the nurses;
but most of the time, this is our first contact. I often ask whether the
parents have ever heard about the NBAS or Dr. Brazelton. My intervention takes place as part of a follow-up framework established by
the CAMSP team in collaboration with the neonatology unit.

The NBAS is an opportunity to open the door to discharge.
The time I spend listening to the parents allows them to talk about

## Page 131

Humanizing the Infant: France 193
their living situation, about the traumatic events surrounding their
child’s birth, and to ask questions they have inside. I give them
specific advice about the care of their infant and introduce the
follow-up plan we are offering to them.

This early first contact in the hospital sets the foundation for a real
therapeutic alliance; because of this solid start, we have observed a
better adherence to our follow-up recommendations. The administration of the NBAS takes place either while the baby is still in the hospital or at the first formal visit as part of the baby’s follow-up program.
In either case, this first visit, during which we share the NBAS
together, establishes the way we are going to get along together for a
quite a while.

The exam and our conversation can easily take more than half an
hour. In our clinical practice, we believe that spending this amount
of time is important. Even if there is a psychologist on the team and
the family knows he or she is available, the first visit (or a visit prior
to discharge) is often too early for them to ask for psychological
counseling. Some will never ask. In that case, they will only speak
about the troubling experiences surrounding their child’s birth a
long time afterward, when problems begin to appear.

Iam a pediatrician, and I realize that sometimes this first meeting
with me might be the only time parents will be open enough to speak
about their infant’s premature delivery, the intensive care their baby
required, and their fears. Sharing observations around the NBAS,
and allowing parents to discuss their special concerns, is the first
step in our follow-up, a process that often lasts for up to 6 years.
How FAMILIES RESPOND
To illustrate the effect of the NBAS experience, I would like to tell you
about the findings of a young midwife who conducted nondirected
interviews with families who had observed the NBAS being administered to their newborns. The question was, “Do you remember the
NBAS exam that Dr. Fabre-Grenet administered to your baby before
discharge from the neonatology unit? Please tell me about it.”

Here is a sampling of the responses from a variety of parents; for
some, the NBAS had been administered quite recently; for others, it
had been several months, or even years:

e “T was happy that someone was taking care of my baby
differently. The exam was less on the medical side, more on the
human one; the doctor was available for me and my baby.
She took time, more than half an hour for us.” This mother said

## Page 132

194 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
that she had also been reassured about the capacities of her son
(his twin had died in NICU during the first week), despite the
fact that he had a small periventricular hemorrhage. I followed
him for 3 years, and he did well.

e Another mother said she had discovered that even though her
daughter was premature (born at 26 weeks of gestation), she
was able to do a lot of things “like a term baby.” She said the
NBAS experience had reassured her about her baby’s competencies, which she had been doubtful about beforehand.
“T saw her as a baby, not as a preemie. .. . She was not a frail
thing anymore; she was my baby.” This mother also said that
she, herself, felt more confident about taking care of her baby
because she saw the baby as less fragile. She saw that the
baby could be handled and had capacities she had never
seen before. She was less anxious about taking her baby home.

e “The doctor was listening. She told me a lot about my daughter
and changed the way I looked at her. After 4 months spent in
the hospital, I needed that exam.” I remember that this baby
was extremely weak and easily overstimulated. This mother
learned to recognize the signs of her infant’s stress and learned
the maneuvers that were effective in supporting her. She also
said, “This exam took us out of the strictly medical realm.
It focused more on our humanity, and with that shift my
relationship to my baby became sealed.”

Over and over, in their own words, these mothers expressed the
wonder of discovering their babies, especially through the NBAS
Orientation items—where it becomes clear that the baby recognizes
the mother’s voice and gazes steadily at the mother’s face—and the
items that demonstrate the baby’s self-protection capacities.

“Humanization,” “decrease of anxiety about discharge,” “the
time spent listening’”—these memories are constantly brought up
in the interviews with these mothers, even 2 years after the NBAS
experience.

CONCLUSION
Why do we sense such positive responses, such relief, when mothers
consistently describe the NBAS experience as “one that humanizes
the infant—finally”? It’s as though those mothers had accepted the
pathological model of the medical staff because they knew that
the nurses and doctors were dedicated to the physiological needs

of the baby and often lacked the time and opportunity to meet with
them around their needs, even if they wanted to.

Setting aside this special time, as discharge nears, seems to have
a specific, useful, and perhaps necessary function. This is the time
we can share with the parents what their babies can teach us. By
doing this in a structured and supportive way, we can support
the development of the baby and support the mother-infant team—
a step that we believe is necessary to improve the quality and effectiveness of the medical care we provide.

The NBAS in a North
Carolina Clinical Setting:
Hospital and Home:
United States
JAMES M. HELM anp MARIE A. REILLY
Our approach to supporting high-risk infants and their families is
deeply rooted in the work of T. Berry Brazelton, Heidelise Als, and
the theoretical traditions they have richly enhanced and advanced.
Our emphasis is on supporting the emerging infant-family relationship, helping both hospital staff and families in the hospital
and at home understand infant behaviors, support self-regulatory
efforts made by babies, and structure both the infant’s environment
and the parents’ care practices with the goal of reducing stress and
maintaining controlled, organized behavior. This chapter focuses
on our use of the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS)!
for multiple purposes.

We offer an array of services that includes Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP)based, developmentally supportive, family-centered care of infants
and families in the intensive care nursery (ICN)**; a developmental
follow-up clinic; and an early intervention program that begins in
the hospital and follows the family home. The NBAS contributes to
each of these services, and we consider it important for families and
for our follow-up program. The NBAS also helps us identify program goals and activities throughout our association with families.

Most of the babies we examine are those who have been in the
ICN, born prematurely, or who were sick or traumatized at birth. We
are part of a Developmental Team that is multidisciplinary and

newborn infant as a mere tabula rasa, or blank slate, and have
replaced it with a view of the newborn as possessing a wide array
of mental skills and predispositions, which enable the newborn to
actively engage with the world from the very beginning. Thanks
to the creative ingenuity of researchers from across the world,
many of whom are featured in this volume, we have come to see
that the newborn infant is indeed competent in all five modalities,
and we have learned that there is a wide range of individual differences in newborn behavioral profiles. There is also an emerging
consensus among researchers today that while newborn behaviors do not lead inevitably to personality traits, they do set up a
range of possibilities; and experience and social factors are obviously transduced into biology, although finding out how exactly
our early childhood experiences reach down into our DNA is the
next big challenge for neuroscientists. These studies also demonstrate that while the basic organizational processes in infancy
may be universal, the range and form of these adaptations are
shaped by the demands of each individual culture from the
beginning. The overarching question of whether we can intervene successfully in children’s lives beginning in the newborn
period is convincingly answered in these chapters and attests to
the shift in emphasis toward an approach to children and families that
is committed to developmental interventions that are both individualized and relationship-based and begin as early as possible in the
child’s life.

It is our hope that this book will not only answer some of the
theoretical and empirical questions posed above, but that it will
generate even more questions for future researchers and lead to the
implementation of the kinds of preventive intervention programs
for infants and families described in this book, ultimately resulting
in more informed policies designed to protect and support children
and families everywhere. Above all, we hope that the perspectives
on infant behavior and development presented here from these very
different cultural settings will reach down into the daily lives of
practitioners and support them in their efforts to enable healthy
infant development worldwide.

includes trainers on the NIDCAP approach, the NBAS, a developer
of the Family Infant Relationship Support Training (FIRST)* program
and trainees on the Brazelton Touchpoints Approach (a program of
the Brazelton Touchpoints Center, an affiliate of the Children’s Hospital in Boston). Members of the team are certified or trained on the
Assessment of Preterm Infants’ Behavior (APIB),° the Test of Infant
Motor Performance (TIMP),° and other infant assessment protocols.
These all influence our clinical practice, and with all these tools available, our approach to each exam and each family varies according to
the circumstances. This depth and breadth of resources allows us to
draw from a rich background. When we conduct an NBAS-based
exam, we prefer supporting parents to use the items from the exam
mutch like the Family Administered Neonatal Activities (FANA).’ At
times, however, we also conduct the exam with parents observing,
or even examine babies when families are unable to attend. We often
don’t score exams; rather we use the exams as a basis for clinical
observations that are documented in ways that meet early intervention requirements or that lead to suggested activities for families or
other interventionists. We are also often able to conduct repeated
exams. The following sections briefly discuss our uses of the NBAS.

FOR FAMILIES

As many others have done, we use the NBAS with families close to
the time their babies are discharged from the ICN, and do the exam
either in the hospital before discharge, in families’ homes, or during a follow-up clinic visit. We find the discharge exam helps families focus much more on the behavior of their babies rather than on
medical issues, such as grams of daily weight gain or oxygen settings. For families who have been in the ICN, this discharge exam
is frequently quite confirming for them, and it gives us an opportunity to discuss developmental processes and offer anticipatory
guidance. For families who have been less able to be with their
babies, the exam helps us talk about their baby’s competencies, as
well as behaviors that might reflect how fragile or robust they are.
In many ways, the process of examining the baby and discussing
observations helps open our relationships with parents. It encourages them to discuss behavior, development, and caregiving. When
we're able to do multiple exams over the course of several days or
weeks, the benefits seem to multiply as well.

As we approach an exam with a family, we often characterize it
as a way to look at how their baby responds to the world and to the
routine kinds of stimulation that he or she is likely to encounter at

## Page 137

198 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

home. We explain that the exam can be viewed as a systematic
presentation of routine care; for example, testing reflexes of the feet
and legs is similar to putting on socks and pants; Pull-to-Sit is similar to getting a baby up off a changing table; orientation items are
like social play, and so forth. Besides allaying fears about a “test,”
this approach opens for discussion a wide range of potential topics
related to a baby’s behavior and responses, such as sleep-wake
states and state control, stability of the autonomic system, regulatory efforts and supports needed for the baby to be successful,
availability of the alert state, tolerance for stimulation, control of
posture and movements, and many others.

The examiner always encourages parents to express their
observations and ask questions. Examiners have the opportunity
to express their observations, as well. Throughout the exam, the
baby’s responses act as a catalyst for discussions that are important
for each parent’s understanding and adjustment—important for
their role as parents. The exam supports mothers and fathers in
becoming more competent parents.

DEVELOPMENTAL FOLLOW-UP

At our hospital, we have a follow-up clinic for babies from the ICN
for up to 3 years. The purpose is to help coordinate complicated
medical care; to monitor and evaluate behavior and development;
to support families, offer suggestions and anticipatory guidance;
and to make appropriate referrals. NBAS exams at discharge give
us good baseline information on the child’s behavior and the family’s
issues. At times the discharge exams are done in the clinic, but whether
the first NBAS exam is done in the hospital or clinic, follow-up
allows multiple exams (NBAS or partial NBAS) timed according to
how closely the child is monitored.

The theoretical constructs on which the NBAS was developed
and through which observations have been interpreted inform our
understanding of babies for some time beyond the age range for
the scale. Behaviors are seen both as current indicators of a baby’s
status and in the context of earlier observations, thereby helping us
appreciate change and progress. In Touchpoint terms, we can use
the baby’s behavior as his or her language to communicate current
status and needs. These behaviors give us a focus to continue discussions on regulatory competencies and the developmental process, as well as individual expressions of temperament or personality,
the baby’s robustness or fragility, and the integration of the new
baby into the family.

COMMUNITY PROGRAMS

In the United States, early intervention (EI) for children with
disabilities can start at birth. Each state has the right to interpret
and implement this program within the national guidelines, and in
North Carolina, children can be made eligible for EI if they have a
developmental delay or any condition included under the category
of “Established Conditions.” This category includes congenital or
neonatal conditions that are most frequently associated with delays.
As of July 1, 2006 neonatal conditions and associated complications
include birth at less than 27 weeks, or birthweight less than 1000 g,
neurologic disease or damage, neonatal seizures, intrauterine growth
retardation, necrotizing enterocolitis requiring surgery, broncho
pulmonary dysplasia that requires supplemental oxygen at discharge from the hospital and others. Even though a variety of conditions can make a child eligible for services, there is still the
requirement for assessment to determine needs. It is required that a
child has an evaluation of his or her:

Present level of development, unique strengths, and needs in the

following areas:

1. Cognitive development

2. Physical development, including gross and fine motor, vision, and

hearing

3. Communication development

4. Social-emotional development

5. Adaptive development

In addition, the evaluation must include a medical component.®

The state recognizes there are no standardized or normed evaluations for these domains of development for babies born prematurely or at the ages that babies are discharged from the ICN, and
therefore allows clinical observations. We use the NBAS and adaptations as the basis for clinical observations and then organize our
evaluation summaries to meet the needs of the EI system, as well as
to guide development of intervention goals and activities.

If a Summary of Existing Assessment Information* is required
early in a premature infant’s stay in the hospital, we use information
gained through the NIDCAP’s Naturalistic Observation of Newborn
* The Summary of Existing Assessment Information is required by the EI system as
part of the process of developing an education plan. The timing for setting this
process in motion varies, being determined somewhat by parental readiness and
preferences.

Behavior (NONB) activity’; and if it’s due around the time of
discharge, we usually use the NBAS. Using the synactive framework
and either of these two neurobehavioral observations, we can characterize the baby’s physiological stability, motor control, and state
control, as well as regulatory efforts, energy, sensitivities, and support needed to maintain organized behavior.'"° These descriptions
help parents and caregivers understand infant behaviors, appreciate
competencies, and formulate goals and strategies that can foster
continued development and strengthen family relationships.

Once observations are made, insights can be formulated to meet
the requirement that each of the five developmental domains is
addressed, as required by EI guidelines. Since the behavioral
expression of these domains in infants overlaps so much, a long
discussion could ensue. For example, a description of regulatory
efforts may fit under the adaptive behavior section for some children, but under the communication or cognitive sections for others; and physiological stability might be of particular importance
in describing a baby’s adaptive skills (e.g., turns pale during feeding), as well as his or her ability to get alert and attentive (e.g., turns
pale with increased respiratory efforts after short periods of faceto-face interaction). The domains may be artificial separations for
babies, but the important information about neurobehavioral
organization gained from an NBAS-based observation can be used

Table 18.1
How Observation Informs Developmental
Intervention Planning

A—Assessment
Description: Baby was born at 25 weeks gestation, weighed 2 Ib. 20z.
(960 g), and is now 3 months old or 39 weeks gestational age.
Communication development: Baby was most available for interaction
when gently swaddled in blankets and stimulation was soft. Her ability
to get alert is just emerging, and when alert, she readily averted her
gaze or went into a drowsy state to control input. She cried or went to
sleep in response to too many demands. During feeding she did best
when looking off into the room rather than at the feeder.
B—lIntervention Plan
Goal: Baby will be able to sustain relaxed social interaction for 5-10
minutes.
Activities: Family will provide a low level of stimulation when engaging
Baby in social play. Baby will be gently swaddled in a blanket during
feeding with low lighting and a quiet room.

to meaningfully describe the baby in meeting state and federal
requirements. An example of a brief description of communication
skills is provided in Table 18.1.

HOSPITAL-HOME EARLY INTERVENTION

Our EI program—WakeMed’s Hospital-Home Intervention Program
(HHIP)—is currently grant funded (Wake County SmartStart)
and allows us to provide continuity for families from the ICN
through their discharge home and for another 5 to 6 months (until
approximately 4 months post-due date). At that point, we work
with families to identify their needs and other community programs
that might best serve them.

The referral process can start as early as a few days after birth
but is also modified to meet the needs of each family, so that the
process is sensitive to the critical nature of the ICN. Services are
blended with the developmentally supportive, family-centered
care that is part of the ICN’s approach to families. Once families
enter the EI system, the formal process of evaluation and IFSP
(Individualized Family Service Plan, required by EI) development
begins. All of the NBAS-based observations described previously
can both meet the evaluation requirements and also lead directly to
functional goals and activities that support the baby’s development
and each family’s relationship with their baby. For example, in
Table 18.1 the description in Section A can lead to suggested activities in Section B. The information used to describe communication
is also clearly of potential importance for describing social-emotional or cognitive development.

The work of Brazelton on the NBAS has led to a cascade of work
that has expanded and enriched our ability to understand infant
behavior. Als and her colleagues expanded the work to help us
understand premature babies; and the work of both, along with
various expansions and adaptations (e.g., FIRST, Touchpoints)
have guided our clinical efforts to support families in meeting the
sometimes daunting challenge of raising at-risk babies.

Relationship-Based Practice
in the Newborn Nursery:
Thoughts for the Pediatric
Professional: United States
CONSTANCE HELEN KEEFER, LISE CAROLYN
JOHNSON, anv SUSAN MINEAR
Soon after the introduction of the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment
Scale (NBAS) in 1973, it became apparent that this comprehensive
research tool could be the foundation for creating a powerful clinical
tool. The NBAS gave clinicians a structure for looking at the baby, a
language for talking about the baby, and, perhaps most importantly,
it modeled behaviors for interaction with the baby. These qualities
suggested strategies for bringing effective relationship-based care
to infants and their families. The fundamental concepts underlying
the NBAS exam are to follow the baby’s lead, to allow her to show
her strengths, to be respectful of her individuality and her needs,
and to bring her to her own best level of performance. They encourage
the examiner to look for the baby’s strengths and allow the baby to
set the pace. In addition, the NBAS requires the examiner to be very
present in the exam. At its heart, the NBAS is a relational care tool
because it gives professionals a way to interact on a relational basis

with the newborn infant and her parents right from the start.

Over the years, two important clinical tools gradually evolved
from the NBAS—the Combined Physical Exam and Behavioral
Exam (PEBE) and the Newborn Behavioral Observations system
(NBO), each of which took the relational aspects of the NBAS a step
further. With the PEBE, the practitioner weaves observations and a
narrative of the infant’s behavior into the standard newborn physical

204 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

exam which he or she performs in the presence of the parents.’ The
development of the NBO drew on our 25 years of research and
training with the NBAS and our NBAS-informed clinical work, and
thus reflects a wide range of theoretical and clinical perspectives.”
The NBO is based on the assumptions, first, that the newborn infant
is behaviorally organized and capable of social interaction from the
very beginning and, second, that the newborn period is a significant
stage in the parent-child relationship. We designed the NBO primarily
as a relationship-building tool that could help sensitize parents to
their newborn’s capacities and individuality. Our goal was to foster
the bonds between parent and infant and between clinician and
family. The NBO consists of 18 neurobehavioral observations that
describe the newborn’s capacities and behavioral adaptations
from birth to the third month of life; it provides parents with
individualized guidance on caregiving based on these behavioral
observations. Behaviors included in the NBO are those deemed to
be of relevance to parental caregiving, so the NBO provides information on the baby’s sleep, feeding, and motor behavior, threshold
for stimulation, crying, consolability, and social /interactive behavior.
In this way, the NBO is used with parents to create a profile of their
baby’s behavioral repertoire. Thus, it enables the clinician to provide
important information to parents about their baby and identify the
kind of support and stimulation optimal for development. This
profile of the infant’s capacities describes the infant’s strengths, as
well as her areas of vulnerability.

Moving the NBAS into the clinical arena was a natural
transition. Those of us who had experience with NBAS research
often carried those little red rattles filled with popcorn kernels
(used for auditory and visual orientation) in the pockets of
our white coats. Unconsciously—perhaps preoccupied with our
thoughts as we were studying a newborn—we would take those
rattles out and shake them. As the baby responded, suddenly we
had something of substance to say to this infant’s mother standing
nearby: “Look, your baby can see and follow this object as it moves.
Watch as she turns her head toward the sound.” Suddenly, this
baby was fascinating. Suddenly, we were much more than nice
pediatricians because now we could say so much more than, “Isn't
she cute!” or “Her eyes are so bright and pretty.” Now we had a
tool that enabled us to understand this baby, and we were able to
share this understanding with the parents. We could explain
what this bright-eyedness meant. We could give parents a framework to help them make sense of their own astute observations
about their baby.

## Page 144

Relationship-Based Practice in the Newborn Nursery 205

Utilizing other aspects of the NBAS, we could explain how this
particular child seemed to have a very fragile autonomic system.
Or, we could say more than just that the baby seemed to have a
mature motor system; we could say, “See how smooth and graceful
her hand movements are—almost like a ballerina. The way she
moves shows me that she has recovered from the stress she experienced during labor.” The NBAS gave us a vocabulary of infant
behavior that is not routinely taught to pediatric clinicians. It
allowed us to see the baby as a real individual at a particular point
on her developmental trajectory. Further, we could orient the parents
to what we observed together in ways that were meaningful and
would help give predictability to this new baby’s behavior.

With the NBO, the clinician now has the time and the tool to focus
on key aspects of newborn development that are clinically relevant
and also meaningful to families. The astute clinician recognizes
that families do know about their newborns and that newborns are
not tabulae rasae but complex persons with a whole repertoire of
abilities. Now, rather than only explaining babies’ behavior to
parents, the clinician is able to adopt an attitude of partnership and
invite the parents to share in the experience of discovering who
this unique baby is. As much as he or she works to keep the baby
in the center of the encounter, the clinician also works to recognize
the parents as central and the medical community as supportive.
The clinician’s language is simple, supportive, and uncoded. He or
she strives to notice and share information with parents rather than
to teach and lecture. In short, the NBO helps the clinician transform
the traditional medical encounter from one that is hierarchical and
focused on pathology to one that is authentic and centered on the
whole person, the whole family.

WHAT IS RELATIONSHIP-BASED CARE?

When we speak of the clinician fostering relationship in the newborn
period, we refer to two distinct relationships—that of the parent
and child, which we are charged with nurturing, and that of the
clinician and family, a necessary component of effective medical
care. The importance of developing each of these relationships
must not be underestimated.

FOSTERING THE PARENT-INFANT RELATIONSHIP

Observing the new baby in the context of the NBO helps parents
see their child as a person, separate and distinct from any other.

## Page 145

206 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

Parents of newborns are beginning to develop a genuine relationship with that child, reconciling the dreams of the baby they had
hoped for during pregnancy and the nightmares of the baby they
had feared. This reconciliation of polar subconscious fantasies into
the vision of a baby they can love is important. Recent research on
newborn behavioral and brain development demonstrates the fact
that if babies experience positive responses from their primary caregivers when they are very young, they actually develop larger,
healthier, more dynamic parts of the brain with which to experience
pleasure, a strong, affirmative sense of self—joy. Why is this important? Because it means they are more likely to become capable, more
likely to exhibit cheerfulness, competence, and confidence, more likely
to behave in positive ways, and, ultimately, more likely to have a
positive impact on the world they inhabit. At one time, ideas like
this were shrugged of as mere idealism. Today, these theories
about the genesis of positive human behavior are firmly grounded
in science.° The NBO gives us a framework for supporting families
as they get to know and understand their new babies; it helps us
build a collaborative relationship based on the language of the baby;
and perhaps most important, it gives us a powerful tool for informing and empowering every new parent to feel more confident and
competent about his or her ability to nurture the new baby.

New parents know that their baby will someday learn to crawl,
to walk, to say words. These developmental tasks are easily identified
and recognized. In contrast, the skills developed in the first weeks
of life, specifically the organization of the autonomic, motor, state,
and environmental responsiveness systems, are more subtle, less
universally understood, and prone to misinterpretation. The framework of the NBO is a powerful tool in helping parents appreciate
the unique individuality and developmental path of their newborn
during these early weeks.

But let us be clear: The goal of the NBO is not to hand the family
a complete understanding of who this baby is and what this baby’s
individual personality is like, but to look at the baby with them and
help illuminate what they are looking at and what they are looking
for. The early weeks of an infant’s life can go so much better when
parents can be helped to understand what their baby is trying to tell
them. For example, we frequently use the NBO as a way of helping
parents of near-term newborns understand their babies. One mother
was working very hard in the first days to help her baby (born at 36
weeks of gestation) learn to breastfeed. Though the baby had a
mature suck-swallow ability, her feeding was inconsistent. While
observing an attempt at feeding, the clinician noticed that the baby

alternated between crying and sleepy staring and explained to the
mother that this was an example of how the baby’s ability to regulate her state was still immature, still developing. Admitting that
she had been totally perplexed, the mother said that the clinician’s
explanation of the behavior—and suggestions for what to do about
it—made sense. The next day, the mother told the clinician, “She
did that same crying-staring thing again last night, so I just let her
chill out on my chest for a while, and she was able to feed better a
little later.” This mother understood the concept of state regulation
in the context of her baby and was able to adapt her caregiving
accordingly; the result was successful breastfeeding.

FOSTERING THE CLINICIAN-FAMILY RELATIONSHIP

More than ever, clinicians face challenges in their efforts to establish
strong relationships with their patients. The demand to see more
patients in less time, the fragmentation of care with a family often
seeing different providers within a primary care setting, the use of
the tort system to compensate patients for medical failures—all
these threaten clinicians’ ability to connect with their patients. This
connection, however, is one of the most important aspects of
the clinician’s role with families, equal at least to knowledge or
technical skill. When relationship is sacrificed, patient care suffers,
clinician morale plummets, burnout occurs, and lawsuits become
mote likely.°’

Because the NBO is predicated on the shared observations of the
clinician and parent, with the infant at the center of the interaction,
it serves as an ideal tool to promote a strong relationship between
the clinician and the family.

THE NBO: A CONCRETE TOOL FOR THE

PROFESSIONAL CLINICIAN IN TRAINING
As clinicians confront the challenges to their time and energy, the
NBO is a concrete tool to help them build relationships with
their patients and to foster parent-child relationships. Though all
clinicians can find this useful, such a tool is particularly important
for clinicians in training. Indeed, a key component of clinician
training must be to maintain the integrity of the clinician-patient
relationship even in the face of a myriad of other responsibilities
that constantly compete for the clinician’s time and attention.

The NBO can be used as an organizing agent for clinicians in
training who want the doctor-patient relationship to be pivotal

208 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

in their practice. In our nurseries, physicians in training are introduced
to the principles of newborn neurodevelopment and the NBO at the
beginning of their rotations. Throughout the following weeks, they
practice the structure of the assessment and learn to incorporate
the language of the NBO into their practice. Each resident is encouraged to develop his or her own style because the NBO is not rote or
mechanical. In addition, residents are encouraged to experiment
with the NBO in a variety of situations, such as the loss of a previous
pregnancy, postpartum depression, first-time parents, near-term or
otherwise developmentally fragile infants, and others. The residents
learn that there is something in the NBO for every family and that
every family is unique.

Through practicing the NBO, the clinician in training has the
opportunity to incorporate several core principles of good medicine:
(1) being a keen observer; (2) meeting the patient, in this case the baby,
where one finds her and keeping her at the center of the interaction;
(3) taking a sincere interest in the family and respecting their knowledge about their own baby; and (4) valuing the concept of a continued
relationship, what we call “keeping the family in mind.”

BEING A KEEN OBSERVER

Keen observation is central to the NBO. The clinician must first
understand the concepts of developmental organization as they
apply to the various systems of the newborn—autonomic, motor,
state, and social/interactive. He or she must then learn to use the
NBO to assess the baby’s level of organization in each of these
realms in order to generate a behavioral profile of the baby. Most
importantly, the clinician must learn how to share these observations
with parents in a meaningful way.

As an example, the clinician who is a keen observer and who
practices the four principles listed previously may walk into a
mother’s room and see her struggling to breastfeed an infant who
is wailing. The clinician, who has come in to begin discharge teaching,
observes the infant’s flailing arms and legs and sees the mother’s
angst. The clinician puts her own agenda aside and begins her
interaction where she finds this mother and baby—struggling over
the attempt to breastfeed. Rather than immediately pointing out the
positioning problems she sees, the clinician sensitively begins by
asking the mother what she thinks: “You’re working very hard!
How is it going?” The mother exclaims in frustration, “He’s hungry,
and I don’t have enough milk!” Instead of refuting the mother’s
opinion with a recitation of medical knowledge about colostrum

## Page 149

Relationship-Based Practice in the Newborn Nursery 209
and sufficiency of human milk, the clinician gently draws attention
to the baby’s behavior. She notes his flailing feet and suggests
swaddling to help him get organized. She notes his beautiful cry
and suggests a little break to help him calm down. The clinician
strikes up a conversation with the mother about normal baby
states and hunger cues. With the baby and mother a little calmer,
the clinician is able to make a few more recommendations—she
swaddles the infant and begins to help the mother position him at
the breast. The mother learns as she listens to the clinician explain
infant behavior and cues, using her own baby as an example. She
is affirmed as the clinician recognizes her hard work, and she is
empowered as the clinician describes the baby’s cues and proposes
possible solutions. Helping the baby latch, the clinician can now
talk about the first week and how the baby will learn—and how it
will not always be this difficult. The mother is now open to hearing the clinician talk about colostrum and the sufficiency of the
mother’s milk. As the baby latches, the mother is more likely to be
open to the possibility of her breastfeeding being a success, and
therefore is more likely to persevere. After this brief encounter, a
trust is established between the clinician and the mother. The next
day, the clinician returns to the mother’s bedside. She makes sure to
mention the previous day. Knowing that the baby’s alertness, and
therefore feeding, should be significantly improved after the first
24 hours of life, the clinician asks the mother how things have been.
She affirms the mother for her hard work and offers support
where needed. In this way, the clinician serves as a partner. She
finds that her skills and expertise are welcomed, rather than unintentionally discouraged because she did not overwhelm the mother
with generic advice, but rather approached her gently through her
own baby’s behavior.

BEING “BABY-CENTERED”

By its nature, the NBO must be carried out in the presence of and,
ideally, with the participation of, the family. The baby must be at
the center of the interaction so that observations can be shared. In
fact, such shared observation can be very powerful, both for relieving
anxiety and for giving parents the authority to refer back to the
shared observations in future conversations with their child’s healthcare professional. Clinicians in training learn to take the baby where
they find her. This is an example of setting aside the clinician’s
agenda and putting the baby first. Having learned the skills needed
for both behavioral and physical assessment of the newborn, the

## Page 150

210 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

clinician in training has the flexibility to move smoothly from one
component to another, allowing the baby to lead. He or she can
observe and describe aspects of the infant’s behavior, complete the
physical examination, and focus on anticipatory guidance—all while
observing and responding to the infant’s cues. If the infant is crying,
the clinician talks about the healthiness of infant cry, different kinds
of crying, ways to soothe a crying baby, and self-soothing. If the
infant is sleeping, the clinician talks about habituation, how the baby
uses this ability to shut out unwanted noises and light, and how
parents can help the baby protect his or her sleep. As the infant
moves from state to state during the examination, the clinician
explains regulation, the importance of organization, the baby’s
cues for overstimulation, and her need for support. As the clinician
fluidly moves through the examination, pointing out and naming
the various aspects of normal newborn behavior, the parents learn
about and have the opportunity to see how the clinician copes with
each. In this way, the NBO models behavior for other aspects of the
young clinician’s work with newborn families. This use of the NBO
is quite similar to Keefer’s description of the PEBE.'

In addition to learning to take cues from the baby, the clinician
must also learn to recognize the behavioral cues of the parent. In
one case, for example, the clinician sees, upon entering a mother’s
room, that she is anxious about taking her newborn twins home.
The clinician stops her discharge teaching to explore the mother’s
anxieties. The mother expresses her concern that her twins aren’t
ready to go home. The clinician is perplexed because, looking at
the medical record, the infants are healthy full-term babies who
have transitioned well and are medically stable for hospital discharge
after 48 hours of life. Rather than explaining the medical reasons
why the babies are ready to go home, the clinician listens. She
proposes to the mother that the two of them undress the babies and
look at them together. Immediately, the clinician senses the mother’s
anxiety decrease, as she perceives that her concerns are being taken
seriously. The clinician uses the language and structure of the NBO
to share with the mother all the aspects of her own babies’ physical
examinations that are healthy and normal. The two also discuss
those important areas of the babies’ physical and developmental
stage that will require extra care, such as attention to head control
and swaddling to prevent their arms and legs from flailing. At the
end of this brief encounter, the mother is visibly open to the clinician’s
opinion regarding the twins’ readiness for discharge. Recognizing
the clinician’s genuine interest in her and her infants, the mother
volunteers her fear: She talks about a friend whose infant died at

## Page 151

Relationship-Based Practice in the Newborn Nursery 211
home. The clinician acknowledges the mother’s fear and does not
meet it with superficial assurances that these babies are normal.
Instead, she proposes another option—a visiting nurse to check on
the mother and babies after discharge. Relieved at the prospect of
ongoing support and reassured about the health of her babies, the
mother is now mentally available to take in important anticipatory
guidance. Having been actually shown the evidence of her infants’
health, she is less likely to be anxious at home and to convey that
anxiety to them. Moreover, in the brief minutes that the clinician
spent during this encounter, her relationship with this mother has
been strengthened, and a key trust has been established.

TAKING A SINCERE INTEREST IN THE FAMILY

It has been our observation that newborns are often examined in
the hospital nursery, away from parents, who are given a verbal
report after the exam is completed. This likely occurs for a variety
of reasons—clinician convenience and time constraints, better
lighting, force of habit, discomfort with the possibility that an
abnormal finding will need to be thought through in the presence
of family members. What is lost, however, is a powerful opportunity
to allow the family to see all the ways in which the clinician has
examined their newborn, to remind them of little questions they
had that the exam triggers, to share the baby with the parents, as
a caring provider—in short, to build a relationship. If instead, the
family merely hears from the clinician, “I looked at her in the nursery and she looks fine,” there is no sense of participation, empowerment, or partnership.

As an exercise, our pediatric residents are asked to consciously
compare the quality of their experience with two families, one whose
baby they examined alone in the nursery and one whose baby they
examined in an interactive manner with the family. The residents
report consistently that the difference between the two encounters
is clear, based not only on the reactions of the families but also on
the amount of satisfaction the clinician is able to glean.

The NBO provides a wonderful vehicle for the clinician to
demonstrate a sincere interest in and respect for a newborn and her
family. The clinician learns to open the encounter with a question
that is most likely to be meaningful to the parents, putting his or
her own agenda aside in order to put the parents and the newborn
first: “What is her name? How did you choose it?” Most parents
care deeply about the name they have chosen for their new baby.
Usually much thought has gone into their decision. There are

## Page 152

212 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

frequently stories that spring from the parents as they recount the
process of choosing their baby’s name. It is not unusual for parents to smile, chuckle, and look at one another as the clinician asks
the question about the baby’s name. Listening carefully to the
answer, the clinician can elicit important social and family history
without asking uncomfortable or intrusive questions. And within
seconds of their telling the story about the name, a relationship is
formed between the parents and the clinician.

The clinician learns the importance of language; using words like
sharing instead of teaching puts the relationship on the level of
partnership rather than paternalism. Words chosen carefully and
thoughtfully can reinforce the parents’ position of legitimate
authority. Sensitively chosen words affirm and can reinforce selfesteem that is sometimes vulnerable. As the clinician observes the
infant with the parents, he or she asks them what they have seen.
Rather than expecting that the parents do not know their infant
and do not understand newborn care, the clinician adopts an attitude that parents do know their infant, and, in some cases, they
know their infant better than anyone else. Not uncommonly, when
asked what parents have noticed about their newborn, mothers
will laugh and describe the infant as though she has been with her
for years—even though the baby is less than 24 hours old. Many
mothers even say something like, “Oh, she has always been like
that!” In another typical scenario, the clinician may invite a teenage
father to call to his baby, asking if he has noticed his baby turning
to voices yet. The father states, “Yeah, yesterday I was talking, and
I saw she was looking right at me.” If the newborn is sufficiently
organized and alert, she will turn once again, in the presence of
the clinician, to her father’s voice and gaze at his face. Much is
accomplished in these few moments. The father swells with love
and pride at his baby’s competence. The baby shows that she knows
and recognizes her father. The father, who is often marginalized in
postpartum settings, feels validated in the observations he has
made about his baby. In encouraging, affirming, and valuing the
parents’ knowledge of their own infant, the clinician has begun to
build a relationship of trust and mutual respect.

KEEPING THE FAMILY IN MIND

Finally, the clinician in training is always learning the importance
of continuity of care, a fundamental component of pediatrics. Using
the NBO, he or she has an opportunity to plant a seed in the nursery
that will establish a continuous relationship with parents and allow

## Page 153

Relationship-Based Practice in the Newborn Nursery 213
them to see that they and their infant are held in the clinician’s
mind as distinct individuals with a unique story. In noticing key
aspects of the infant’s behavior or the infant’s talents at birth, the
clinician remarks, “Won’t it be interesting to see what she is doing
when I see you next!” At the next visit, noting the same aspect of
the assessment (e.g., head control), the clinician says, “Look what
she is able to do now! Remember what she did in the nursery? Now
she can control her head so much better!” This seamless thread that
the clinician has created between one encounter and the next serves
to establish a trust in the parents’ minds that the clinician is caring
for their infant and does remember her. With this trust as a foundation,
the relationship grows.

CONCLUSION

There are contrasting ways to view hospital newborn care. One
view is that the pediatrician’s job is to make sure the baby has all its
parts and that the parents have enough information to keep the
baby alive until they come in for their first appointment. Our view
is quite different. We see the birth of a new child as a normative crisis,
one that is a different experience for every family. There are vulnerabilities in being a newborn on that first, second, third, or fourth
day of life. At the same time, whether the child is a first baby or not,
the parents are also developing—physically, emotionally, and socially.
There are new responsibilities, new financial issues, and concerns
about other family members who will also need to make adjustments for this new person in their midst.

We believe the physician’s role is to watch over that normative
crisis, to be available to it, to be whatever it is that the parents need
us to be through this all-too-brief hospital stay. The challenge is
that you never know which family is going to need what. You can
scan your list of patients and dismiss a particular family, thinking,
“Well, they won’t need me.” Then you discover that the mother,
who seemed so capable and so “together,” is suddenly traumatized
by the way her 3-year-old is responding to the new sibling. Collectively, as pediatric care providers, it is our role to be available to
address whatever issues may arise surrounding the newborn, and
our families respond very positively. In fact, their responses
reinforce the philosophy that underlies our approach—a healthy
family is the ideal environment in which to safeguard and nurture
the healthy development of a newborn.

Instead of making assumptions, we try to recognize what this
experience is like for each family. We’ve learned that our being

## Page 154

214 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

available is particularly important for first-time parents. They need
to know our support is there when they need it during this unique
life stage. It’s a time when parents need a hovering guardian
angel ready to answer questions and provide encouragement and
positive reinforcement—to provide a scaffolding (“That was great.
Should we look at something else?”). It’s not an exaggeration to say
that the parent-clinician interaction can be a model for caregiving
itself, for the kind of positive reinforcement and careful skillbuilding that we know to be the framework on which healthy
infant development is built.

Given the real world, a pediatric clinician who comes to see a
particular baby the first day after birth might not expect to see the
same family the next day or later in the outpatient setting. We
believe that’s all the more reason to make the time we do have with
that family as rich an experience as possible. There are many things
we can do to help the parents of healthy thriving infants in that initial visit. We can help them get to know and understand their new
baby. We can help build their confidence about their ability to care
for their child. We can help them feel comfortable about calling us
if they do have questions. We can remind them that someone, whether
ourselves or someone else, is expecting to see them in a few days or
a week, whenever that first well baby visit is to be scheduled.

As clinicians who recognize the importance of relationship as
fundamental in medicine, we also recognize the need to instill this
awareness in clinicians in training. Clinicians in training today need
a concrete tool, complete with language, to help them learn and
practice the art of building relationships. The NBO serves as such a
tool; it is a valuable organizing agent for clinicians in training and
other professionals who choose to make relationship a key component
of newborn care.

When we hear back from families we met in the hospital, they
often express gratitude for what we have done for them and their
babies. Sometimes our medical and technical skills have been
important. But almost always they thank us for supporting them
and for understanding the anxieties and confusion that almost
always accompany the birth of a new baby. They say, “Thank you
for listening,” and “Thank you for helping me understand my baby.”

Clinical Example
During the NBAS examination, the baby’s family looked on—mother,
father, three siblings, ages 7, 10, and 12, and a 12-year-old cousin. Maggie
was just 12 hours old. Her mother had been on bed rest for the previous

5 months due to risk of premature labor.

As the examiner checked Maggie’s Habituation responses, Maggie’s
mother sighed with relief: “It’s so good that she can sleep through noise!”

Then, as the examiner checked Maggie’s walking reflex, her mother
excitedly instructed the rest of the family: “Watch! See her walking!”

The Orientation segment of the exam was the first time Maggie’s
siblings had seen her with her eyes open. Maggie’s focused alertness
was superb, and her audience was captivated: “Look! Oh, she’s turning
to look at your face!”

By the time the exam was over, Maggie’s mother had tears in her
eyes. “You've made my day,” she said, “I feel so much more confident
about her now than I did before. Look how much she can do, even
though she’s so little.”

Maggie’s father was less emotional, but equally impressed: “Tt really
surprised me to see how she could follow the toys with her eyes, and
turn toward the sounds of the rattle.”

Before the NBAS examiner could leave the room, Maggie’s mother
asked her to be in a picture with all of them. She was delighted to
become part of this joyful family memory.

“The NBAS has changed my life!” This dramatic comment
expressed by anewborn nursery nurse is not unique. The Newborn
Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS)! and the Newborn Behavioral
Observations (NBO) system have indeed changed the practices of
many professionals around the country and abroad.’

In teaching these assessment scales to a variety of professionals—
nurses, physicians, and therapists—we find that this kind of
comment is more the rule than the exception. The NBAS and related
tools, such as the NBO, completely change the way people who
work with babies interact with them. NBAS and NBO training
enhances all existing skills and supplements them with new
methods of observation and intervention when caring for infants.
Less task oriented than the more widely used Dubowitz newborn
assessment, the NBAS focuses on interpreting the newborn’s
behavior based on his neurological maturity.

It is quite instructive to observe a physician trained in the NBAS
or the NBO perform a routine physical examination of an infant.
The concepts that originally inspired development of the NBAS are
seamlessly incorporated into the exam and are a delight to observe.*
Because the concept of “best performance” is a guiding principle of
the exam, the physician will take great care to help the baby stay
calm and comfortable. For example, the infant need not be totally
undressed; only the parts of the body to be examined are uncovered,
one at a time. This is because most young infants simply do not
like the sensation of being completely uncovered. When the infant
frets, the NBAS-trained physician consoles him by cradling the
baby with his or her hands, providing a brief time-out in order to
let the infant become calm before continuing with the examination.
The examiner will explain to the parents that when a baby cries he
has used all of his own self-soothing resources and is seeking help;
he may be asking to be held or fed or changed; he may want a
pacifier; or he may simply want to be left undisturbed for a while.
(Sometimes the examiner can provide comfort so effectively that
the baby actually falls asleep.) Explaining and demonstrating this
kind of responsiveness supports the infant and reassures the parent.
Further reassuring the parent are the gentle techniques used to
trigger reflexes. For example, when eliciting the asymmetrical tonic
neck reflex (ATNR), it makes sense to elicit the rooting reflex first,
thereby stimulating the head-turning movement of the ATNR.*
To the parent—and family—who might be observing the exam, this
maneuver demonstrates sensitivity, gentleness, and competence—
serving to both inspire and model confidence. Imagine, in contrast,
a parent’s reaction if the examiner were to grasp the infant’s head

## Page 159

218 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
and turn it firmly, a maneuver often used in the usual physical
exam, which—not surprisingly—can be upsetting for the infant.

A thorough introduction to the amazing abilities of the average
newborn is the cornerstone of the NBAS-based training model we
use at the Brazelton Institute. By attending didactic lectures and
PowerPoint presentations, and participating in guided examinations
of newborns, the professional becomes skilled in reading behavioral
cues of infants and learning how infants communicate through
their behavior.

Few early intervention professionals, including doctors, nurses,
and physical and occupational therapists, have had extensive
training in neurobehavioral assessment, which is the core of the
NBAS and the NBO. Training in these concepts becomes essential if
the professional is to work effectively with infants and their families,
especially high-risk infants.°® Because many of these infants are
very sensitive to external environmental stimuli, an NBAS-trained
examiner will always proceed with caution, interpreting the infant’s
responses carefully, and adjusting his or her way of handling the
child in order to meet the infant’s immediate needs.

The key point is that behavior is never random; it is always
externally or internally caused, and the infant’s reaction to a
stimulus is how he communicates his need for support. Learning
to observe minute changes in color, respiration and heart rate,
tonus and posture, and quality of movement, as well as changes in
states of consciousness, deepens the professional’s understanding
of how complex the newborn infant is, and how he is attempting to
deal with his environment. This method of observing infants can
be life-changing for professionals, and they will never again look
at babies in the same way. Learning how to communicate this
information to the infant’s parents is part of the training. It often
confirms the parents’ own observations of their infant and enhances
the parent-child relationship.”*

Professionals trained in NBAS concepts change their practices as
they reflect on what they have learned from the exam and what the
infant has communicated to them. They learn that the behavior of
the infant is the language of the infant. A behavioral profile—what
Brazelton calls “the infant’s signature”—can be written delineating
the infant’s strengths and vulnerabilities. From that point, a plan of
intervention can be designed appropriate for both the infant’s
needs and those of his parents. When used in the postpartum
period, “this assessment offers health-care professionals an opportunity to support parents in the important phases of an evolving
relationship with their child. Participation in the exam helps

## Page 160

Preparing Professionals to Work with Newborns 219
reinforce new parents’ instincts about their newborn infant while
encouraging them to ask questions about important items such as
feeding, social issues, home and family environment, and so on.””

SPECIFIC TRAINING MODELS

Several training models have been developed by the Brazelton
Institute in preparing professionals to work with infants and their
families in various settings. The classic model is quite intensive and
introduces the trainee to the newborn infant’s amazing abilities to
communicate neurobehaviorally with his environment and with
his caregivers. Trainees are shown a video of the NBAS exam,
which gives them an overall view of the scale being administered
and allows them to observe the infant’s responses, thus acquiring a
good baseline knowledge of neurobehavioral responses and their
meaning. After the video, a presentation focusing on specific items
in the exam is given. The item could be, for example, Habituation
to the sound of a rattle. A discussion ensues exploring how the
infant uses Habituation to shut out disturbing sounds or other
sensory stimulation to ensure restful sleep, and what a valuable
technique this is for long-term development. Next, Reflexes are
shown and discussed, with an explanation of all the primitive
reflexes found in the newborn, how to elicit them, and how they
are part of the marvelous central nervous system of the newborn
and can be indicators of normalcy. The slides cover all the items in
the scale and describe them in great detail. The various subsystems
of the infant—state, motor, autonomic, and self-regulatory—are
discussed from the perspective of how they appear when the infant
is stressed, as well as how they appear when the infant is stable.
Also, techniques are demonstrated for consoling, and for eliciting
interaction—both animate (with a person) and inanimate (with an
object). The point is made that the examiner decides which item
to use for beginning the exam depending on the infant’s state of
consciousness, and from that point is led by the infant to decide
which item to move to next. For example, if the infant is asleep,
Habituation can be evaluated. If the infant is awake, interaction is
attempted; and if the infant is crying, consoling is done. The slides
present much in-depth information about the exam, its administration, and the infant’s responses and how to interpret them.'”"° After
reviewing all this material and the NBAS manual, trainees are
ready to start practicing on their own.

The next segment of training occurs at the hospital, where the

all of the infant’s responses and demonstrating holding, handling,
and elicitation of the items in the scale. Together, trainer and trainee
reflect on what they saw the baby communicate in this exam, and
the trainer explains in detail and how to write up the infant’s
behavioral profile based on their observations.' The trainee has the
opportunity to administer one or two exams with the guidance of
the trainer, practicing his or her newly acquired infant handling
and examination skills, and improving them through feedback, suggestions, and demonstrations provided by the trainer. In becoming
more attuned to the language of the newborn, the trainee learns to
interpret the infant’s cues and respond accordingly. A newborn, for
example, who is flailing wildly with arms and legs, is often begging
for help with quieting his motor system. The experienced examiner
will gently cradle the baby, bringing his arms in close to his body,
supporting and containing his legs and feet so he can feel the
familiar enclosed comfort of the fetal position.

HOSPITAL-BASED MODELS

There are several hospital-based models of training using both the
NBAS and the NBO. One model, designed for staff nurses in
neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and special care units (SCN),
teaches staff nurses how to read the behavioral cues of the infants
and adjust their nursing care accordingly. A direct example of this
developmentally focused approach is the way a nurse prepares
an infant for hands-on care—speaking to the baby and gently
laying his or her hands on the infant before beginning. In this
way, the sensitive infant is allowed to awaken gradually and is
prepared gently for caregiving, rather than being awakened
abruptly and having the procedure begin without any advance
warning—which can be quite disorienting for a fragile infant.
A nurse who understands how to do so can pace all care according
to the behavioral and developmental needs of the infant, with lots
of time-out breaks allowed for the infant to reorganize and recover
some stamina in order to deal with the caregiving. An indirect
example of developmental care is the change in the NICU/SCN
environment. Nurseries are more dimly lighted; sound levels of
both mechanical equipment and staff voices are muted; and
activity levels are quieter and more respectful of the infant’s need
to experience restful sleep, which is restorative. Research studies
have shown that this approach is beneficial for the infant in terms
of improved medical and developmental outcome, and can lead to
shorter hospital stays."

## Page 162

Preparing Professionals to Work with Newborns 221

Other hospital-based models train newborn nursery nurses to
incorporate NBAS concepts into the newborn bath experience.
In one training model, the nurses are taught how to use the concepts
of slow gentle handling and positioning—allowing the sides of
an oval tub to support the infant in flexion while gently bathing
the infant immersed in warm water up to his chin in the tub.
Many infants become so relaxed, they fall asleep in the tub. The
nurses learn to be led by the infant’s behavioral cues—states of
consciousness, color, tonus, and motor activity—and to adjust
their care accordingly. The infant stays very calm during the bath.
Once the bath is completed, the infant is gently lifted out onto a
warm towel prepositioned on the shoulder of the nurse. The nurse
wraps the infant in the towel and dries him by patting him gently
inside the wrapping of the towel. His lower body is slowly
unwrapped to put on a diaper, while his upper body is kept
wrapped in the towel, then his upper body is slowly unwrapped to
put on his shirt. A study evaluating the effects of this bath method
showed positive results.”

In another model using NBAS concepts during bathing, the
nurse describes the infant’s behavior to the mother during the bath
using NBAS behavioral terms: states of consciousness; sucking and
grasping for self-consoling; the infant’s response to the Pull-to-Sit,
and to stand, step, and crawl; the vigor of his cry; and what he
needs to be consoled. The interactive bath is a mini-NBAS experience, providing the parent with much information about her
infant—and all done within the context of the newborn bath.’

A third model incorporating NBAS concepts and used in
hospitals and in educational settings is the Parent Infant Pathways
(PIP) program. This model is both a teaching guide for professionals
and a parent education curriculum addressing the first months
of the infant’s life.

This model provides professionals with a powerful way to demonstrate
and discuss a newborn infant’s many capabilities and helps facilitate the
acquisition of positive parenting skills ... through the use of seven key
vantage points or Pathways. PIP gives professionals dynamic ways to
impart important information about infant development, and to support
new parents and their babies. It has been proven to be an excellent tool
for training professionals in how to educate parents about newborn
development, provide parents with anticipatory guidance, and connect
families to community resources."*

It is always gratifying to see firsthand how learning to understand
their newborn’s amazing resources and unique patterns of behavior

## Page 163

222 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

can help new parents quickly gain confidence—and competence. A
skilled examiner encourages the mother to discover her baby’s individuality for herself, confirming and interpreting what she has
noticed. Parents come to the NBAS having already observed many
things about their babies. The examiner facilitates further discoveries and also provides important insights that will guide the mother
in caring for her child. Perhaps one of the most valuable benefits of
the NBAS experience is the degree to which it can relieve much of
the distress that almost all first-time parents feel when their babies
cry. By explaining that crying is meaningful behavior and suggesting strategies for soothing the crying infant, NBAS examiners help
parents feel confident about their ability to respond appropriately.

Utilizing NBAS concepts in work with infants is enormously
gratifying. Infants are so much more responsive than new parents
realize, and it is very exciting to be able to confirm for parents the
amazing abilities of their newborn infant and provide intervention,
if needed.’

The NBAS or the NBO may not actually change the lives of
every professional we train, but certainly it will change forever
their clinical practices.

CHAPTER 21
Integrating Developmental
Principles into the Daily
Work of Health Professionals:
Italy
GHERARDO RAPISARDI, ADRIENNE DAVIDSON, ROBERTO
PALUDETTO, anp GIUSEPPINA MANSI
Two Brazelton Centers have been functioning in Italy since 1996:
one in Florence, directed by Dr. Gherardo Rapisardi, and the other
in Naples, directed by Dr. Roberto Paludetto. Both directors have
extensive experience in the use of the Brazelton concepts and in
assessing newborns and promoting both neonatal and child health.
The activities of the two centers differ in accordance with the
specificity of the professional curricula and the everyday clinical

environments in the two locations.

EXPERIENCE IN FLORENCE

Dr. Rapisardi, a neonatologist and pediatrician, works in collaboration with Adrienne Davidson, a pediatric physical therapist and
developmental specialist. Both trained in infant neurological assessment and intervention with Professor Adriano Milani Comparetti
in the 1970s, and they have been working together at Anna Meyer
Children’s Hospital since the beginning of the 1980s.

In Florence, the efforts of the Brazelton Center have focused on:
(1) the clinical application of a global neurodevelopmental (ND)
assessment and an early intervention program that incorporate the
principles of the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and
224

## Page 166

Integrating Developmental Principles into the Daily Work 225
the Touchpoints Approach; (2) training courses in the Brazelton
concepts for all types of health professionals throughout Italy who
are involved in neonatal care; (3) diffusion of the Brazelton concepts through the publication of written articles, translation of English texts, and so forth.

CLINICAL APPLICATION

The Florence-based authors were trained in Boston in 1985 and
1986, respectively, learning to administer the NBAS directly from T.
Berry Brazelton and J. Kevin Nugent, learning about individualized developmental intervention in the NICU directly from Heidelise Als, and also completing the Touchpoints training. Since
then, Rapisardi and Davidson have worked to integrate these diagnostic/analytical tools with Milani-Comparetti’s model.' Their
evaluations also include the General Movements (GM) assessment*** proposed by Prechtl and his group (including Giovanni
Cioni from Pisa and Fabrizio Ferrari from Modena).

The integration of these approaches (from Milani-Comparetti,
Brazelton, Als, and Prechtl) has led to the development of a practical
neurobehavioral assessment tool? which is now used for early evaluation of at-risk newborns in the NICU, in the neonatal follow-up
service, and in the early intervention clinic 0 to 3 years, where infants
are sent for consultation by health professionals, mainly pediatricians, working in other departments of this hospital, in other hospitals, or in community pediatric and rehabilitation services.

This assessment tool focuses on the observation of spontaneous
motor and interactive behavioral activity during the four different
phases of development in the first year of life: 0 to 3, 3 to 6, 6 to 9,
and 9 to 12 months, according to the stages of the separationindividuation process. Three main parameters are assessed:
(1) autonomic stability, particularly in the first trimester; (2) motor
activity, divided into the nonfunctional spontaneous movement
repertoire and the adaptive functional motor repertoire; and
(3) behavioral modulation in relation to interactions with people,
objects, and the environment. The items assessed in the 0-to-3-month
phase are illustrated in Table 21.1.

This model of ND evaluation allows for the early assessment of
normality and includes an assessment of the competencies of the
individual infant within his family system, as well as an early diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP) and other severe ND impairments (sensory deficits and interactive disturbances) within the first 3 to 4

months of corrected age®”*; it can also be used to assess the emergence of competencies within an individual’s impaired development. A basic principle of this model is the differentiation between
a nonfunctional motor repertoire, which is primarily affected in
central motor disturbances, and its functional adaptive use (functional motor repertoire), which is only secondarily affected. The
nonfunctional motor repertoire is assessed by GMs until 4 to 5
months postterm, and then by the richness and variability of the
motor patterns and the distal segmental movements of the hands
and feet.

The ND assessment tool that we use is a simple, nonintrusive
method, intended to be included within routine assessment by different professionals (neonatologist, pediatrician, child neurologist,
physical therapist). The overall main goal is to enable them, through
the assessment of the normality of the central nervous system, to
reveal the strengths and the difficulties/problems in the infant’s
development, as well as any deficit needing more investigation.
The information collected in this way then serves as the basis for
developing a plan based on the main principles of family-centered
ND intervention that are focused on the promotion of subsystem
development and the enrichment of the family environment in
which the baby is growing and maturing.

All therapists working in the pediatric rehabilitation service at
the hospital have received the Brazelton training; and the Brazelton
concepts are integrated into all the clinical work with small
babies carried out in the various clinics within the department,
including the pathological cases in neonatal follow-up, and within

## Page 169

Integrating Developmental Principles into the Daily Work 227
the 0 to 3 years early intervention consultations requested by the
community pediatric and rehabilitation services. These concepts
are particularly useful as a base for supporting parents of children
with developmental problems, even as they grow beyond the first
months of life.

TRAINING IN THE BRAZELTON CONCEPTS
The education of health professionals working with neonates and
their families is the main goal of our venter. Since 1996, five different multiprofessional courses incorporating the Brazelton and
Touchpoints concepts have gradually been developed to promote
continuous education in behavioral and ND assessment and family-centered intervention in the NICU and in the first year of life.
The courses are as follows:

e Behavioral Assessment and Family-Centered Developmental

Support of the Term Newborn

¢ Neurodevelopmental Assessment in the First Year of Life

¢ Individualized Neurodevelopmental Care in the NICU

¢ Neurodevelopmental Follow-Up and Intervention for the

Preterm Infant in the First Year of Life

¢ Communication and Counseling in the Support of Families

Up to mid-November, 2005, 83 interdisciplinary courses had
been held in Florence and throughout Italy, with a total of 3,138
participants (40% pediatricians /neonatologists, 24% physiotherapists, 17% pediatric nurses, 8% child neurologists, 6% psychologists,
4% midwives, 1% other developmental therapists).

The first course, Behavioral Assessment and Family-Centered
Developmental Support of the Term Newborn, is considered the
foundation; its main goal is to promote the integration of the NBAS
concepts into the everyday clinical routines of all the variety of
health professionals working with neonates and their families. As an
everyday tool, we propose the use of a simplified version of the NBAS
associated with the basic facilitation techniques of newborn behavior
and the application of the principles of family-centered developmental intervention. The focus is on the use of the baby’s behavior as a means of relating to the parents—sharing the baby’s
language to create and strengthen the partnership between the
professional and the family. This relationship is then proposed as a
channel to support the parents and to discover together their
personal approaches to effective baby care. The possible risks of

## Page 170

228 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

diminishing parental self-esteem by appearing, for example, to be
an expert or a teacher are examined, as is the risk of being prescriptive
rather than collaborative. The multidisciplinary participation in the
course provides opportunities to experiment with a transdisciplinary approach to problem solving, both in small groups and in the
plenary discussion.

Recently, we carried out a small trial investigation on the
effectiveness of the training 3 months after the course; through an
anonymous questionnaire, participants were asked to describe the
positive effects on their professional routines, as well as the difficulties they had experienced in trying to apply what they learned
during the course. We also asked this study group to send short
videos showing examples of their practical use of the assessment
and intervention with families.

Positive aspects reported were enhanced interest in understanding newborn behavior and in the understanding of the neonate’s abilities (to self-regulate and to influence his environment), improved
abilities to recognize neurovegetative signs, and increased appreciation of the concept of providing anticipatory guidance. Other
positives were increased tendencies—and preferences—to listen
rather than intervene, and to promote informed choices rather than
provide solutions.

Other positive effects mentioned were improvements in the
clinical setting and in working together with other professionals
(“sharing the new tool for an interdisciplinary approach to baby
care”). At the same time, difficulties encountered dealt mostly with
interdisciplinary communication, inadequate settings in the working environment, especially in hospitals, and the lack of an opportunity to verify skills in the assessment items under supervision, at
a distance of time. Through the videos, we managed to identify the
general abilities of the professionals and their difficulties.

Both the feedback and our observations resulted in a revision of
course (content and time distribution), as well as our teaching
methods. We also made changes to offer better support to participants in order to improve their interactive skills with the newborn
and his or her family.

DISSEMINATION OF THE BRAZELTON CONCEPTS

To promote knowledge of the Brazelton concepts in Italy, the
Brazelton Center in Florence supports the publication of original
and translated articles and texts; an Italian version of the third edition
of the NBAS manual and the two books on Touchpoints (0 to 3 years

## Page 171

Integrating Developmental Principles into the Daily Work 229
and 3 to 6 years) are available.?’”"” As a result, in the past 10 years,
knowledge of the Brazelton concepts has spread throughout Italy.
Unfortunately, it is still not part of the curriculum studiorum of all
health professionals working with infants. Yet, more and more
teaching and training programs are recognizing the value of the
Brazelton approach and are including it in postgraduate training
within programs for continuing education. We observe that as this
approach becomes more widely used, its value for the promotion
of child health in the early years is being acknowledged, especially
by family pediatricians.

EXPERIENCE IN NAPLES
The Brazelton Center in Naples, led by Drs. Paludetto and Mansi,
has utilized the Brazelton NBAS with both term and preterm
newborns.

The NBAS has facilitated both our research and our care of
newborn infants and their families, particularly preterm infants.
As far as full-term newborns are concerned, interest has mainly
focused on jaundiced neonates. Our first study was performed in
order to evaluate possible changes in behavior in jaundiced infants
without perinatal complications other than hyperbilirubinemia
treated with phototherapy. Thirty jaundiced infants (mean bilirubinemia 13.3 mg/dL) and 30 of a comparison group were examined during the third day of life according to the NBAS. We
demonstrated that the jaundiced subjects were less responsive to
stimuli, mainly in the visual orientation responses area. Moreover,
we showed that such responses were compromised up to at least
1 month of age.’

In a second study, we tried to reduce the effects of phototherapy
on the newborns’ behavior by protecting the eyes with an opaque
screen suspended over the head instead of using the usual blindfold
in order to avoid covering the newborn’s eyes during treatment.
However, we obtained no statistically significant improvements in
the newborns’ neurobehavioral development."

In a third study, we focused our attention on the effects of low
levels of bilirubin. We selected term newborns with a mean serum
bilirubin concentration equal to 10mg/100 mL, therefore studying
newborns who did not undergo phototherapy. These levels of
bilirubin did not significantly influence the behavior of this group
of term newborns.’

In recent years, less aggressive protocols for the treatment of
neonatal jaundice have been formulated. Such protocols recommend

## Page 172

230 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

starting phototherapy when serum bilirubin levels are higher
than 17 mg/100 mL. This revision has allowed us to publish a
new study’ that investigates the behavioral changes induced by
moderate hyperbilirubinemia in the otherwise healthy, untreated
newborn infant. Fifty term neonates with untreated moderate
hyperbilirubinemia (median 14.3 mg/dL, range 13.2-20 mg/dL)
and 50 matched controls with lower bilirubin concentrations
(median 9.1 mg/dL, range 5.3-12 mg/dL) were evaluated using
the NBAS at 87 hours of life (range 72-110 hours). A subgroup
analysis was also performed at 104 hours of life (range 96-134
hours) and at 3 weeks of age.

The first examination showed that all behavioral clusters were
significantly altered in the group with moderate hyperbilirubinemia. After 24 hours, a decrease in serum bilirubin within the
moderate hyperbilirubinemic group was associated with improved
scores. At 3 weeks of age, the behavioral assessment of the two
groups did not show significant differences. Our conclusion, then,
is that untreated moderate hyperbilirubinemia is associated with a
transient, and apparently reversible, alteration of neonatal behavior,
particularly in the social-interactive area.

Stretching the scale’s rules a little, we have also worked with
preterm newborns who showed no serious diseases and who did
not need mechanical ventilation, in order to study the maturation
of their sensory and interactive abilities. On the whole, we found
more evident maturation in the areas of Motor Performance and
Orientation during the 35 to 44 weeks of postmenstrual age.'”? With
such methodology, this study was among the first to indicate the
early development of Auditory Orientation (which is similar to that
of the term newborn at 35 weeks of postmenstrual age), as opposed
to the development of Visual Orientation, which is slower.

Moreover, an evident delay was demonstrated in the ability to
bring the hand to the mouth; this skill was very much compromised
in our preterm newborns even after they reached term age (40 weeks
of postmenstrual age).'® We hypothesized that this was probably
due to the absence of the physiological intrauterine stimuli that
enhance sucking and the movements that help centralize the limbs
on the median axis (liquid environment, containment by uterine wall,
and so forth). As a matter of fact, these infants have obliged postures
in the incubator; they are exposed to gravity, which constrains them
to the mattress; sometimes, the obliged postures are kept for a long
time, and may be due to immobilization procedures.

What we’ve learned through the NBAS has prompted us to
carry out more specific interventions with parents. In our NICU,

## Page 173

Integrating Developmental Principles into the Daily Work 231
parents have been actively participating in the care of their infants
in incubators since 1976.”

Our goal has been to help parents strengthen their relationships
with their small premature infants by suggesting the most appropriate sensorial communication techniques, such as postures,
manipulations, and cuddling. These simple interactions between
newborn and parent represent a very early form of care, which has
been increasingly implemented in most Italian centers during the
past several years.

Our group has also investigated the effects of nonnutritive sucking
in the preterm infant. We have demonstrated for the first time that
nonnutritive sucking alleviates behavioral distress (resulting in a
reduction of crying) during invasive procedures.”

Presently, our attention is focused on the effects of maternal
smoking during pregnancy on the neurobehavioral development
of the healthy, term neonate. The aim of our study is to correlate in
detail the newborn’s neurobehavioral abilities with the biological
markers of maternal smoking (urinary cotinine).”!

Last, we have used and are still using the NBAS in routine
clinical practice both in the NICU, which has been opened to
parents since 1976, and in the nursery, where rooming-in has
always been the norm.

We have incorporated the general concepts of the scale with the
physical examination of the newborn, with special attention to a
few specific items—Orientation, Decrement to Stimuli, Self-Quieting,
Consolability, and Cuddliness.

Although we have not evaluated its impact in detail, our
experience with the NBAS has proven it to be a useful tool for the
professional enrichment of all providers dealing with the care of
the neonate.

CHAPTER 1
The Discovery of the Human
Newborn: A Brief History
J. KEVIN NUGENT

It is perhaps difficult for the twenty-first century researcher or
clinician to imagine how much our understanding and appreciation
of the human newborn has changed since the time the Neonatal
Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) was first published in 1973.
The dominant view for much of the earlier part of the twentieth
century, as Berry Brazelton and many authors in this volume
point out, was that infants were generally passive recipients of
sensory stimulation, responding to environmental input with
innate reflexes. There was scant evidence that learning could
be demonstrated in the first few weeks or even months of life.
Newborn assessment tools reflected these assumptions, so that the
earlier neonatal scales, which emerged from the field of neurology,
focused on the assessment of the so-called primitive reflexes and
postural reactions.’*° Because it was assumed that the newborn
infant was indeed a “blank slate,” a reflex organism operating at a
brain-stem level, the classic tests of intelligence, such as the Gesell
Developmental Schedule, the Cattell Infant Intelligence Scale, and the
Griffiths Mental Development Scale, for example, did not include any
items designed to assess newborn behavior.

However, a number of advances, especially in the fields of
psychology and psychiatry, contributed to a major shift in thinking
about newborn behavior and development and, indeed, to the
notion that the newborn period might be a critical time in
the development of the parent-infant relationship. In the early
1960s, it was assumed that the newborn could see only shadows at
birth. And then, Robert Fantz demonstrated that the newborn
infant could not only see but also had clear-cut visual preferences.*

CHAPTER 22
A View from the Lab
RACHEL KEEN

When I was in graduate school at the Institute of Child Development,
University of Minnesota, in the early 1960s, my professors advised
the graduate students to avoid giving advice to parents. Although
we were getting our doctorates in child psychology, we were not
to advise the public on child rearing. “We don’t know enough to
comfortably tell people how to raise their children,” was the word
we got. I think this was somewhat in reaction to the Institute’s past
history of being very much in the forefront of giving parents advice,
some of it ill-founded. But in the 1960s, there was a retreat back to
the laboratory, with no pretense that we knew something that in
fact we did not.

I took this advice to heart in my research and teaching in the
1960s and 1970s, so I was extremely cautious when answering
students who asked for child-rearing advice. My plan of action was
to show all sides of an argument, describe pro and con research,
and then leave it to the students to take from it what they would.
While this may have suited some, one day a student emerged out
of a large class of 500 to confront me with the following accusation:
“You never say anything for sure!” It was a comment that elicited
profound pondering on my part.

Beginning with my dissertation, I have been studying infant
behavior for around 40 years. I began with newborns, and over the
years have studied various aspects of infant behavior throughout
the first 2 years of life. As a graduate student scouring the literature
Preparation of this manuscript was supported by Grant HD27714 from the
National Institutes of Health and Human Development to Rachel K. Clifton
(now Rachel Keen).

238 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

in the early days, it struck me how little we knew about infants,
especially newborns. Their hearing, their vision, their sensitivity to
pain, their responses to caretakers, their capacity to learn—all
seemed unknown territory. Space is too short to cover all aspects of
infant behavior, so I will concentrate on what we have learned
about infant hearing because it has direct implications for infants’
care and well-being.

When I researched the literature for my dissertation in 1963, the
dominant view was that infants were generally passive recipients
of sensory stimulation, responding to environmental input with
innate reflexes. There was scant evidence that learning could be
demonstrated in the first few weeks of life. The literature suggested
that newborns’ fluid-filled ears impair their hearing for the first
few days. No one remotely suggested that the fetus of 7 to 9 months
might be responsive to sound. Forty-something years later there is
a ton of evidence that in the last month before birth, immediately after
birth, and continuing thereafter, the infant hears quite well and can
make amazingly fine discriminations between sounds.'*

The Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) was one of
the first ways that parents could be shown directly how responsive
their newborn baby was to sensory stimulation, including light and
sound. The NBAS influenced my own hearing research very directly.
Around 1978, I wanted to study whether newborns could localize
sound. Prior to this, I had tested newborns lying in their hospital
cribs, delivering sound through speakers and measuring heart rate
change. Now an interest in sound localization made me seek a
directional response like head turning. We adapted the Brazelton
rattle (popcorn kernels shaken in a plastic container) as our stimulus and the NBAS procedure of holding the baby with head centered rather than lying in a crib with head to one side. With back,
neck, and head well supported, the newborns turned readily to the
tape-recorded rattle presented laterally.

We progressed through a series of studies, manipulating duration
of the rattle stimulus from very short (less than 1 second) to several seconds, and manipulating its repetition rate.* We discovered
that not every sound is so attractive to newborns. We concluded
that the rattle sound is effective in eliciting head turns because of
its broad bandwidth, covering frequencies from 50 to 7000 Hz.
However, the newborn must hear the sound for a duration of at
least 1 second for it to be effective. If the sound’s duration is shorter
than 1 second but repeated at a rate of 2/second, the newborn will
orient toward the sound. The NBAS uses two extremely effective
stimuli to elicit head turning—the shaken rattle and the human

## Page 182

A View from the Lab 239
voice. Both have broad bandwidths and rhythmic properties, making them useful stimuli for researchers interested in determining
the parameters of newborn hearing.

Not only are newborns sensitive to sound, but they appear to
remember sounds from one day to the next. To test memory for
sound, we presented newborns with the same sound several times
until they stopped responding. This decrease in responding to a
repeated stimulus is known as habituation, and all normal infants
show it. When we presented the same newborns with the same
sound 24 hours later, they responded less than a control group who
were hearing the sound for the first time.’ Many years later, we tested
the specificity of this habituation.® On Day 1, a group of newborns
was exposed to a recording of a female voice repeating a single word.
The newborns readily turned toward the voice, and after several
repetitions, they habituated. On Day 2, the group was divided so
that one subgroup heard the same word they heard on Day 1, and
the other group heard the same voice repeating a new word. There
were two interesting effects: (1) The group hearing the same word
failed to turn toward the side the voice was coming from as much as
the group hearing a new word, and (2) in fact, the group hearing the
same word actually began turning away from the side the sound
was coming from, as though seeking to avoid hearing it repeated. In
this case, novelty seemed to be more attractive, and the familiar,
repeated word became less attractive. The important point is that
newborns remembered or recognized the word that they had heard
on Day 1, retaining this specific information for at least 24 hours.

Work from other labs has shown retention of auditory information over even longer periods—spanning from fetal life to postnatal life. DeCasper and Fifer gave newborns pacifiers that were
hooked up to a device whereby a change in the rate of sucking
would produce a recording of the mother’s voice or a stranger’s
voice.’ Newborn infants learned to suck appropriately at the rate
(either slower or faster) that would produce the mother’s voice. This
is apparently due to the experience of hearing the mother’s voice in
utero and recognizing its familiar cadence, rhythm, intonation, or
some other property.

Should scientists have suspected this sensitivity to sound before
the research showed it with certainty? As mothers brought their
infants to my lab to participate in hearing research, I would often
engage them in conversation. No mother seemed surprised to learn
that infants were extremely sensitive to sound. Some told charming
stories of playing certain music when they were pregnant and then
realizing that their babies responded to that same music after they

## Page 183

240 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

were born. In retrospect, no one should have been surprised at
DeCasper and Fifer’s finding that newborns prefer to hear their
mothers’ voices over strangers’ voices, but it was big news at the
time. Infants’ sensitivity extends to music. Trehub and Trainor have
studied infants’ reaction to “good” versus “bad” musical patterns
and have shown they can detect pitch contours of rising and falling
melodies.’

There is a great deal of data indicating that infants’ most exquisite sensitivity to sound is reserved for speech. I next review briefly
what we have learned about infants’ discrimination and sensitivity
to speech sounds. Very young infants, soon after birth, can discriminate phonemes, the basic units of speech sounds. Infants are
universal discriminators, meaning they can detect differences in
speech sounds that you and I cannot. As adults, our ears are now
tuned to our native languages. In learning certain languages that
use a set of phonemes that are distinctly different from those of our
native language, we will have difficulty. For example, Japanese
speakers have trouble with the English distinction between /r/
and /1/, and English speakers cannot hear contrasts between
certain phonemes in Czech or Thai. Infants have no problems with
any of these contrasts. Their powers of discrimination are better
than ours. (See Jusczyk for an excellent review of this literature.)’
We now know that the “tuning up” process comes late in the second
half of the first year of life. That is, as infants start to understand
the meaning of words and also begin to produce speech themselves, this universal discrimination ability declines.'° However, the
ability to learn new language sounds remains very plastic, and
children can pick up a second language easily during preschool
and early childhood. As we age, learning a foreign language gets
harder, all of which implies that we should not wait until high school
or college to teach students a new language.

Because hearing and speech are so much at the core of human
nature, knowing about infants’ exquisite sensitivity to the sounds
of language and music can make them seem more mature and
more human to parents and, in fact, to all those who work with
infants. “Motherese” is the term for the special way mothers and
other caretakers speak to infants. It has been studied crossculturally and has been found to have commonalities across
many languages."

We can say with great confidence to parents, “It is extremely
important to talk to your infant right from birth.” It will be many
months before the meaning of the words is understood, but from the
beginning, infants can distinguish among different sounds; they are

## Page 184

A View from the Lab 241
sensitive to cadence, rhythm, and modulation of speech; and they
need to hear speech directed toward them.

In addition to exposing infants to “good” sounds, we need to be
concerned about exposing infants to sounds too loud and environments with continual noisy backgrounds. The former can damage
hearing, and the latter can fatigue hearing, making it more difficult
to detect important sounds over ongoing noise. Early assessment
of auditory impairment is also critical because amelioration through
hearing aids and early exposure to sign language are available and
effective. Exciting work has shown the ease with which infants,
either deaf or hearing, can pick up sign language from their caretakers." We need to educate parents about how normal infants
respond to sound, coupled with prompt assessment if hearing loss
is suspected, in order to ensure that every infant experiences good
communication in the first year of life.

There is a great need for researchers to bring their work closer to
practitioners and policymakers. The gap can be bridged, but it will
take sustained, deliberate efforts on both sides. First, researchers
need to make their results and implications more easily available
beyond their own circles. This can be done through special publications that both researchers and practitioners would read and write
for. This volume is exactly the type of vehicle for this interchange
and should inspire similar volumes in the future. Second, researchers need to deeply ponder the implications of their findings for
practical problems, but to do this, they need to talk to social workers, pediatricians, nurses, and other personnel who intervene in
children’s lives. Symposiums that provide a forum for the needed
interchange between researchers and clinicians are one way to
ensure that the dialogue is undertaken—and continues. Third, collaborative research should be the core of continued communication.
One way to facilitate this would be to bring together researchers
and clinicians in workshops whose purpose is to design collaborative studies. The studies would then be carried out by those attending the workshop. Only when the lines of communication are freely
open and flowing will we have the knowledge exchange we so
badly need.

CHAPTER 23
Parent-Infant Bonding
and Doula Support
JOHN H. KENNELL
PREFACE FOR THE HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER

In a period when health-care professionals and clinicians caring for
children are asked to prevent and/or manage an ever-increasing
number of children with developmental/behavioral problems of
increasing complexity, it is heartening to know that simple interventions in the perinatal period might prevent or modify these
problems. Almost 40 years of research have shown that when
mothers have continuous emotional support by a doula during
labor, and when they have early and extended contact and interaction with their babies, significant benefits can result. To emphasize
the value of a woman companion who is warm, supportive, and
caring, the Greek word doula was chosen for a laywoman caregiver
who provides continuous physical, emotional, and informational
support to the mother during labor and delivery.

Results can be even better when contact is skin-to-skin, with
privacy for the mother and father, if the baby can crawl to the breast
and self-attach, and if the mother and baby can live in together
through the hospital stay. Research studies show further benefits
if the perinatal caregivers are positive and supportive and show
the parents some of the amazing abilities of the newborn, and if the
mother breastfeeds through the first year.

Special efforts to avoid separating mother and baby during the
hospital stay immediately after birth are often necessary because
separating mothers, fathers, babies, and families has been so
ingrained in maternity units for the past 100 years. For the past
25 years, in the majority of hospitals, families are no longer

244 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

separated, but it is still difficult to keep mothers and babies together.
The perinatal period—from the onset of labor to several days
after the baby’s birth—is a remarkable time, the so-called maternal sensitive period, because events during that time (what is said,
what is done) can have remarkably strong positive effects on the
later behavior of the mother and father, effects that might not be
possible to achieve at a later time.

From the evidence presented in this chapter about parent-infant
bonding and doula support, it appears that returning to many of
the childbirth practices followed by our ancestors for hundreds
of thousands of years should result in many fewer child behavior
problems. Many more children will be on the path to becoming
securely attached to their caregivers by 12 to 14 months. We now
know that securely attached children usually relate well to parents,
peers, and teachers and make relatively smooth progress through
childhood and into early adult life.

PARENT-INFANT BONDING

The term bonding refers to the feelings of love and commitment
parents develop for their infant. This feeling of deep, emotional
connection can occur at various times. Some women experience
this bond during pregnancy when they begin to feel movement.
Some, even earlier, because today, with ultrasound, the mother and
father can see their child’s first heartbeats and begin to fantasize
about who this baby will be. Other parents feel this emotion at the
birth of their infant, and still other perfectly normal parents take a
week or longer to sense this bond.

A number of factors influence how parents perceive their infant.
In the past 30 years, numerous studies have explored how mothers
and fathers develop a special tie to their infants. This curiosity
about bonding was stimulated by the fact that some parents have
difficulty “taking on” their newborn baby, especially if the infant
had a problem or the parents had unresolved issues from their own
childhoods or from current life stressors.

Research has also identified hospital practices that make it harder
for mothers to feel close to their babies. As an example, taking the
baby away shortly after birth and keeping the baby in the newborn
nursery has inhibited many mothers from getting to know and feel
at ease with their newborns.

One of the changes being made as a result of this research is the
phasing out of the newborn nursery. The baby is kept in the mother’s room during the hospital stay, so she can get to know her baby
and begin to breastfeed and suckle her infant when he or she is

## Page 188

Parent-Infant Bonding and Doula Support 245
hungry. The UNICEF/WHO Baby Friendly Initiative (BFI) requires
breastfeeding within one hour, rooming-in, and no bottles. Babies
who were cared for in accordance with the BFI recommendations
breastfed longer than control babies. More significantly, the BFI
reduced infant abandonment in hospitals in three countries. When
the baby is ill and needs special care, it is imperative that the mother
and father are involved as soon as possible with their infant in
order to avoid estrangement or fear that the baby will die.

It is helpful to recognize the powerful physiological forces at
work, as well as the psychological ones, to enhance bonding. When
giving birth without medication and without an epidural, the mother
produces the hormone oxytocin. This naturally produced hormone
has a variety of important functions. It strengthens the labor contractions. Oxytocin is extremely helpful in reducing the mother’s pain
both during and after labor by raising the pain threshold. After
the birth, it helps contract the uterus to eject the placenta and prevent bleeding. When the baby breastfeeds, suckling creates an oxytocin spike in the mother that produces the milk letdown. Oxytocin
produces strong feelings of calmness, and women with elevated
oxytocin levels feel more relaxed, and often sleepy. This hormone
(often called the “cuddle” hormone) helps mother and baby feel
closer. In addition, oxytocin is a major nonstress hormone, which
helps shift the stress system (sympathetic nervous system) to the
nonstress system (parasympathetic system). Oxytocin helps activate
19 gastrointestinal (GI) hormones in both the mother and the baby.
Some of these GI hormones, in turn, produce longer villae in the
intestines—those tiny hairlike structures that increase food absorption in the breastfed baby and in the mother.

When artificial oxytocin (pitocin) is given to the mother during
labor, it does not get into the mother’s brain and, therefore, it does
not produce the same effects. In fact, pitocin has been seen to interfere with the naturally produced hormone and can cause more
painful contractions. Research has shown that the calm presence
and help a doula provides—with her caring touch, appropriate
massage, visualizations, and so forth—also enhance the mother’s
oxytocin levels. This type of support helps avoid factors that can
make a birth traumatic for parents. A traumatic birth, one in
which the mother feels helpless, with no sense of control, inadequate, demeaned or humiliated, betrayed or damaged, can greatly
affect the mother’s perception of her infant.

If a normal bond does not occur, parents may project onto the
baby their own distress; they may not see the baby for himself, but
rather as a manifestation of distress in their own lives. When natural
bonding is prevented, parents may not pick up their baby’s signals

## Page 189

246 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

that would otherwise help guide them in figuring out what they
should be doing to meet the baby’s needs. These signals indicate
not only the baby’s basic physical requirements but also the emotional responses the baby needs. Babies are motivated by emotion
and affect and, therefore, the emotional responses from their parents form a foundation for the infant’s sense of self.

Understanding the six states of consciousness or awakeness can
help parents recognize what signals or needs the baby may indicate in each state. There are two sleep states (quiet and active); then
the third state, drowsiness; the fourth state, quiet alert; the fifth
state, active alert, where the baby shows interest in looking around
rather than just looking quietly at the parent’s face; and finally, the
sixth state, crying.

The parent-infant bond is enhanced by early and continuous
contact. The longest period of the quiet alert state in those early
days occurs right after birth. In this state, the baby is especially
interested in seeing the faces of his mother and father, hearing their
voices, smelling them, and feeling their touch while he is acclimatizing to the outside world. Parents can be helped to learn about
and appreciate their baby’s natural abilities in this state, in which
the baby can imitate the mother’s tongue protrusion, follow the
parents’ faces or an object, turn to the mother’s voice, and stop crying when held by the mother or father.

Most health-care institutions have made changes in the care of
healthy newborns and their parents to support parent-infant bonding. Usually fathers, other family members or friends provide continuous support during labor. Early contact of the baby with the
mother—skin to skin on her chest with an opportunity to crawl,
self-attach to the nipple and have the first feeding—is the ideal start
for early and long term benefits. In the delivery room, after the
feeding or when the nurse is attending to the mother, the father
will have a chance to hold and interact with his baby. Mother and
baby are kept together throughout the hospitalization. Breastfeeding guidance from nurses and lactation consultants and roomingin help the parents to learn about the abilities of their infant and
make decisions about the care and feeding of the new member of
the family at home.

CONTINUOUS LABOR SUPPORT BY A DOULA
More than 30 years ago, Dr. Marshall Klaus and I were studying
breastfeeding at a maternity hospital in Guatemala. Most women
coming to that hospital were separated from family and friends

## Page 190

4 LOOKING BACK
In terms of auditory capacities, the prevailing assumption among
both researchers and clinicians was that newborns’ fluid-filled ears
impaired their hearing for the first few days. However, in 1963 a
report appeared in Science showing that newborns could orient
toward a sound as early as 8 hours after birth.° In the previous year,
Murphy and Smyth had demonstrated that infants respond to
auditory stimuli even before birth.®

The notion that the baby could see, hear, and respond differentially to positive and negative stimuli inspired a new body of
scientific research on newborn behavior and development. While
innovative thinkers from the emerging field of infant mental health,
such as John Bowlby, Donald Winnicott, and Selma Fraiberg, studied the mother’s role in the development of early parent-infant relations, a new generation of researchers, among them Jerome Bruner,
Peter Wolff, Jerome Kagan, Robert Emde, Kathryn E. Bernard, and
Arnold Sameroff, stimulated by the work of Jean Piaget, began to
study learning in infancy in an effort to determine how early and
under what conditions infants could learn. In the 1960s and 1970s, a
new body of research on newborn capabilities emerged, which provided a rich empirical database for subsequent conceptualizations
of newborn and infant development. Researchers such as Lewis
Lipsitt, William Kessen, T. G. R. Bower, and Rachel Keen developed
innovative research methods to demonstrate that newborns could,
indeed, learn from the very beginning. This new body of data, which
provided evidence that the newborn infant was competent and
complex, contributed significantly to the development of the NBAS.
However, it was Berry Brazelton’s clinical experience with parents
and his work at the Children’s Hospital in Boston that led to a pivotal concept in the thinking about how to assess newborn and infant
development—the concept of individual differences. As Brazelton
himself explains it, the challenge he faced was how to describe,
identify, and ultimately code these differences in a reliable manner.
He had provided evidence for differences in crying patterns in his
own research and later presented his ideas on individual differences
to a wider audience in his groundbreaking book, Infants and Mothers:
Individual Differences in Development.’”* In the preface to that book,
Jerome Bruner wrote, “What delights me most is Dr. Brazelton’s
unflagging sense of human individuality.” It was Brazelton’s recognition that infants were unique, with their own individual styles of
responding, that prompted him to begin the quest for a scale that, on
one hand, could do justice to the newborn’s capabilities and, on the
other hand, could describe the full range of individual differences in
newborn behavior.

and labored alone with no analgesia. We were dismayed by the
distress and pain of the laboring women, but observed the calming
effect when we asked a female Guatemalan research worker to
enter a labor room to talk with one of the women. This serendipitous observation has led to more than 20 years of research in the
United States on the perinatal effects of continuous support provided by a trained labor companion—a doula.

META-ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST RANDOMIZED TRIALS

Management of obstetric patients in Guatemala in the late 1970s
was quite different from current U.S. practices. While Guatemalan
women labored alone without our present-day obstetric technology,
American women are rarely alone during childbirth. In spite of
well-trained and experienced obstetric teams, childbirth practice
involves increasing emphasis on intervention, medication, and
technology while the human elements of comfort and support are
often deemphasized, or left out entirely. The demands on labor and
delivery nurses are so great that they can spend less than 10% of
their time providing supportive services. By adding continuous
doula support to the labor experience, we and other researchers
found remarkable positive perinatal effects. This result was demonstrated in a meta-analysis of the first six randomized controlled
trials conducted—two in Guatemala and one each in Canada, South
Africa, Finland, and the United States (Houston, Texas). With the
continuous support of a doula: cesarean deliveries decreased by
50%, use of forceps by 40%, requests for epidural analgesia by 60%,
need for pain medication by 30%, pitocin use by 40%, and, perhaps
most significant of all, labor length decreased by 25%. These first
six randomized clinical trials were conducted in hospitals that did
not permit family members or friends to be present with the laboring woman, or allowed only brief visits.

RANDOMIZED TRIAL: DOULA SUPPORT FOR COUPLES

At this point in the investigation of the effects of doula support,
questions remained about the generalizability of the positive effects
for middle, or upper, income groups or for women accompanied
by their husbands or other family members during labor and delivery. As a result, a study was conducted involving 555 healthy
women expecting to be supported by their male partners through
labor for their first baby; the women were randomly assigned to
either the control or the doula group. They received routine

## Page 192

248 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

obstetric care from their personal obstetricians or from the hospital’s obstetric staff. All were permitted to have family members
present during labor and delivery. Of the women accompanied
only by their male partners, 22.5% required a cesarean delivery
compared to 14.2% of those supported by both the father and a
doula. This study showed the value of doula support for all mothers, whether laboring alone or with a partner. The doula does not
displace the father, but supports him—showing him how he can
be helpful, and relieving much of his anxiety. Fathers, as well as
mothers, say they could not have managed the labor without the
doula’s support.

RANDOMIZED TRIAL: MANAGEMENT OF LABOR PAIN

Another study compared epidural analgesia, narcotic analgesia,
and doula support as alternate methods of managing labor pain.
Four hundred and twenty-seven low-risk primigravidas in active
labor were randomly placed in one of three groups. At the first
indication of pain, patients in the control group received narcotic
analgesia, and epidural analgesia was given if requested by the
patient. Patients in the doula group continued with the support of
their doulas (which had begun at the time they entered the study)
and other comfort measures.* Meanwhile, patients in the epidural
group received epidural analgesia at the first indication of pain
after they were 4 centimeters dilated.

For all pertinent demographic variables, the three groups (narcotic analgesia, doula, and epidural) did not display any significant
differences. All of the patients were considered low income; 87%
were Hispanic, and 83% were born outside the United States. The
average age of the women was 21 years, with a range of 14 through
37. Average maternal education was 9 years.

The day after delivery, women in the study, using a visual analog
scale, were asked to rate their pain before and after receiving a pain
intervention—either narcotic analgesia, epidural analgesia, or doula
support. Women in all three groups reported a significant decrease in
pain after receiving intervention. Women in the epidural group
reported the greatest decrease, and women in the control (or narcotic
analgesia) group reported the least change in pain level. Doulasupported patients fell between these two groups in the decrease in
pain that they reported. On 10 items related to the experience of labor,
“If the mother required pain management beyond the comfort provided by the
doula, a small dose of narcotic medication or epidural analgesia was administered.

## Page 193

Parent-Infant Bonding and Doula Support 249
the patients in the doula group consistently responded most positively, with a statistically significant difference on 6 of the 10 items.
They reported more pride in themselves, a greater sense of accomplishment, more positive feelings about their coping ability, and a
better overall labor experience—a great start for a new mother.
MECHANISMS FOR EFFECTIVENESS OF DOULA SUPPORT
A review of anthropologic data about birthing practices in 128
representative nonindustrialized societies indicated that in all but
one, support was provided by a woman. Studies in human and primate mothers have indicated the association between acute anxiety
and arrests of labor, and that increased levels of catecholamines
(epinephrine and norepinephrine) decrease uterine contractibility
and result in a long labor. One possible mechanism to account for
the results in the doula studies is the effect of the doula as a source
of strength and confidence to relax the laboring woman, reduce her
anxiety, and, as a result, reduce her catecholamine levels.

Another possible mechanism to explain the effect of the doula is
that the close contact—touch and massage—provided by the doula
may stimulate the production of oxytocin in the mother’s brain,
resulting in slight drowsiness, euphoria, and an increased pain
threshold, all of which help the mother relax and allow the labor to
progress more easily.

DoULA SUPPORT BENEFITS THE BABY

The long-term advantages of doula support may be even greater
for the baby as demonstrated in three separate studies that examined changes in mother-infant interaction following doula support
during labor. In addition to the direct effects of the doula on the
course of labor and delivery, there are effects manifested after
the birth of the baby that are of special interest to those who care
for children and families.

In the first study of doula support in Guatemala, both control
and supported mothers and their babies were observed in a
standardized situation through a one-way mirror in the first 25 minutes after leaving the delivery room. The doula-supported mothers
showed more affectionate interaction with their infants, with significantly more smiling, talking, and stroking than the mothers who
did not have a doula.

Investigators in Johannesburg observed the physiological health
of the women and infants in both the control and supported groups

## Page 194

250 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

for 6 weeks after the delivery. There were favorable effects of doula
support on the subsequent psychological health of the women and
infants. At 6 weeks, there were also impressive behavioral differences postpartum. A significantly greater proportion of women in
the doula group were breastfeeding (51% compared with 29%).
Mothers in the doula group said that during the first 6 weeks after
delivery they spent 1.7 hours a week away from their babies, in
contrast to those in the no-doula group, who spent 8.6 hours away.
The doula mothers noted that it took an average of 2.9 days for
them to develop a relationship with their babies, compared with
9.8 days for the no-doula mothers. These results suggest that support during labor expedited the doula group mothers’ readiness to
fall in love and bond with their babies, and they spent less time
away from them. At 6 weeks, mothers in the doula group remained
significantly less anxious, had scores on a test of depression that
were significantly lower than the control group, and had higher
levels of self-esteem. These maternal qualities are all favorable
indicators for the development of the infants. The doula mothers
also felt significantly more satisfied with their partners 6 weeks
postterm (71% compared with 30%). Not only did these supported
mothers show more positive behaviors with their babies, but they
more often rated their babies as better than a standard baby—more
beautiful, more clever, and easier to manage—than did the control
mothers, who perceived that their babies were slightly less
beautiful and less clever than a standard infant.

The third evidence of doula support favorably affecting the
mothers’ interaction with their babies comes from the narcotic
analgesia-doula—epidural study. Primigravida mothers with
uncomplicated vaginal deliveries were randomly assigned to a
doula (n = 33) or one of two no-doula (n = 71) groups (control or
epidural) as described previously. A home visit was made to
observe the mothers’ interactions with their infants. Mother-infant
(M-I) interaction was scored on a scale of 1 to 7 that included
operational definitions of the mother’s physical contact, visual
attention, and affectionate behaviors toward her child. The M-I
interaction was assessed at five predefined points during the visit:
(1) when the examiner entered the mother’s house, (2) while a
Bayley exam was being set up, (3) while the exam was being scored,
(4) during a feeding, and (5) while the mother changed the baby.
Interrater reliability was .91 across two examiners who were blind
to group assignment. The M-I interaction scores revealed significant
differences between the doula-supported and no-doula group of
mothers. The doula-supported mothers’ mean interaction score

## Page 195

Parent-Infant Bonding and Doula Support 251
was significantly higher than the no-doula group of mothers for
4 of 5 observation points (p<.05). Overall, the mean M-I interaction
scores of all 5 observation points for the doula and no-doula groups,
respectively, were significantly different (p<.001). The results demonstrate that providing a laboring woman with the continuous
support of a doula results in a significantly more positive level of
interaction with her infant at 2 months after delivery. Questions
remain regarding the mechanism that could explain this powerful
and long-lasting effect of doula support. Does doula support
release and sustain normal hormonal and behavioral responses
that may be restricted or inhibited by factors associated with a
hospital birth without a doula?

The similarity of a mother’s behavior with her baby after she has
doula support and after early and extended contact (i-e., rooming in)
show her to be more responsive, attentive, and sensitive to the unique
needs of her baby, compared to mothers who do not have these
experiences. Support by a woman during labor and rooming in,
and being with her baby continuously had been the pattern for
almost all mothers for hundreds of thousands of years up until 100
years ago. When mothers and babies are together, skin-to-skin,
from birth, studies are showing important physiologic benefits for
the baby and the mother, and breastfeeding is more successful.
Have we inadvertently decreased the responsiveness, sensitivity,
and attentiveness to their babies of thousands and thousands of
mothers with our modern hospital obstetric practices and the use
of narcotic and epidural analgesia? Has this resulted in a mother
having a more negative view of her baby, or of her own labor and
delivery performance?

Mary Ainsworth found that when the mother was responsive,
attentive, and sensitive to the unique needs of her baby during its
first year, the infant at 13 months was usually observed in the test
situation to have a secure attachment.'*? The evidence at present
indicates that many children identified as securely attached, or
insecurely attached at 13 months, continue these patterns into
adulthood.

Securely attached children usually become peaceful, thoughtful,
considerate adults; while children with the insecure attachment
pattern at 13 months may have feelings of distrust and ill will
toward others in later childhood and adulthood.

Will restoring support during labor, early contact with rooming-in,
and avoiding mother-infant separation lead to an increase in the
numbers of securely attached infants at 12 to15 months? In making
decisions about optimal obstetric care, it is crucial to look beyond

## Page 196

252 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

the short-term goal of achieving a healthy delivery to the long-term

goal of launching a healthy life.

CONCLUSION

Doula support is a low-tech, centuries-old intervention that

significantly reduces the need for cesarean delivery, analgesia, and

other interventions; shortens the length of labor; enhances motherinfant interaction; and helps promote successful breastfeeding.

There are benefits for mother, father, and baby. If doula support

were a medication or electronic device, there would be a rush to

obtain this for every obstetric service in the United States. However,
continuous doula support is not provided to all women. If we
accept the empirical evidence that continuous doula support can
foster stronger parent-infant bonding, more securely attached
children, and healthier families for future generations—then we
can only conclude that all women should labor and deliver with
the continuous support of a doula.

CHAPTER 24
The Brazelton Baby:
The Other Side of the Coin
ED TRONICK

The Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) examination was
not yet formed into a coherent structure when I began to work on it. I
met Berry Brazelton in 1968 when we were both fellows at the Center
for Cognitive Studies at Harvard University, which was directed by
Jerome Bruner. Jerry was at the beginning of his quest to understand
the development of the mind and had brought together an exceptional
group of individuals that included Tom Bower, Colwyn Trevarthen,
Berry Brazelton, and others. Tom was working on infant perception,
Colwyn on the developmental organization of head and eye movements, and Berry on a method for the behavioral examination for
newborns. I was working on infant vision, infant-mother/ face-to-face
interaction procedure and the “still-face” Needless to say, this was an
exciting group of which to be a member; we had endless discussions,
arguments, and mutual challenges in seeking to understand what
infants could and couldn’t do. Our assumption was that the infant
could do everything, and the limit was on our ability to figure out how
to demonstrate this. We were brash—and wrong.

Sometimes, spurred by the intensity of the research activity, we
would sneak away on Saturday mornings to the newborn nursery
of the Mount Auburn Hospital. There, Berry was the maestro,
demonstrating this or that capability—strange-sounding “organized”
pieces of behavior—the Babinski response, the Glabella reflex, the
plantar grasp, crossed-extensor movements, conjugate eye movements, stepping, the tonic neck reflex. We witnessed habituation
and orientation to sounds, objects, and faces—all accomplished by
a tiny organism that was, according to “the literature,” disorganized
by internal and external events. At the time, I had the impression
254

## Page 199

The Brazelton Baby: The Other Side of the Coin 255
that Berry was an incredibly skilled puppet master. Yet, not much
later, I acquired the skills to elicit all these reflexes and reactions
myself, although never with his deftness.

The challenge posed by Jerry and Berry was to take this jumble
of magical pokes and prods, elicitations, movements, and tonalities,
and make them real: organize them into some systematic form,
figure out how to score them, and then how to score them reliably.
A thousand questions were posed: Which items should we keep?
In what order should we administer them? How should we describe
the infant’s state of consciousness? (This is a term I later return to
in my own work on meaning making and psychoanalysis.) Which
items tell us something? Which don’t? Even if items don’t tell us
anything, do we still need them to make the examination whole
and challenging enough? Should we use a red ball or a checkerboard
for visual orientation? (Red ball.) Should we use dried corn or
beads in the rattle? (Corn, most definitely.) Should we orient the
infant to the bell, or only to the rattle, or to both? (Both!) And dare
we do the pinprick using a real pin pushed through a cork (of no
vintage) so that only the merest tip of the pin pricked the infant?
(Yes. And if you are not ambivalent, no one will object. But the
ambivalence did come—later—and the pinprick was dropped.)

The biggest task was to systematize the examination so that it could
be reliably and validly scored. And like the behavioral elicitations
themselves, the science of creating an examination was a mystic
process based on formulaic incantations (Rs and alphas and r’s)
and numerology (3-point scales, 7-point scales, and then, finally,
the 9-point scale). Well, at least this was an arcane magic I understood. But what of this perfect 9? Were the 9 points to be arranged
in a singular direction, heading toward the truth, or in a curve with
both tails problematic, but in different ways? Should there be a single
summary score? (No!) Should there be a standard protocol for
administration? (Again: No!) Rather, we would try to optimize
performance to go after the reification of individual differences,
the uniqueness of the newborn, and the uncovering of his best
performance. We wanted to see what the baby could do, to find out
what was inside the baby that could be made manifest when
scaffolded (Jerry’s word) optimally by a reliable examiner.

Finally, when all our questions to one another had been answered,
when all the decisions had been made, when all the items had
been systematized and the scoring procedure was complete, the
examination—the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale—was
published as one of those now-familiar red books.' Berry generously offered coauthorship but the deep concept was his, and I

## Page 200

256 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

turned it down. The book offered instructions and images (some
done by me), score sheets, and scoring guidelines. Soon after the
examination’s first use in a research study was published in a
scientific journal; this time, the publication was green.” As a co-author
along with others—Frances Horowitz, Arnold Sameroff, Barbara
Koslowski, Daniel Freedman, Henry Ricciuti, John Robey—I was
proud to see my name in an honored position in both the red book
and the green journal. Thereafter, in later editions these names no
longer appeared and the exam was often referred to not by its
acronym, the NBAS, but by its personified nickname: the Brazelton.

The standardized reliable magic of the Brazelton was now a
reality, available in manualized form to all those who needed it for
research and clinical purposes. Trainings, which enabled practitioners to become masterlike—consistent administrators and reliable
scorers—began taking place in Boston and Berlin, Washington and
Wilmington, Lisbon and Lincoln. The NBAS fulfilled its promise of
delimiting the normal variation of the behavior of the infant and
providing a preview of an infant’s individuality. It gave a starting
point, which was never a zero point, for seeing how the infant
affected his own developmental trajectory, and how the infant’s
uniqueness affected his caregivers and even shaped his culture.
It became a tool for research. It was sensitive to how the world—
medications, toxic substances, cocaine, heroine, nicotine, and even
parenting—affected, and often distorted, the normalcy and uniqueness of the infant. Had we thought about it, we would have known
that we were seeing the manifestation of the brain in the body of
the infant; and we would have known we were seeing how the
world sculpted that plastic organ. But we did not yet know enough
to look at these changes—what Barry Lester later called the “recovery
curve”—to see how they played out over time.

Eventually, the focus of the examination—which had initially
looked at uncovering the optimal individual baby (How well did
the baby habituate? orient? move?)—was reconceptualized to
evaluate the interaction of the baby and an examiner. This new
concept was truer to the NBAQ’s first principle of bringing out the
infant’s optimal performance, that is, describing not only the infant,
but also how the infant could interact. By revealing the babywith-someone, the examination could show parents the baby
they would be taking home. In fact, a question was added to the
examination based on this new concept: It asked the examiner to
“rate how much you would like to take this baby home with you.”
As acomplement to this greater understanding of the NBAS, Barry
and I developed the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale

## Page 201

The Discovery of the Human Newborn: A Brief History 5

At around the same time, Peter Wolff’s seminal work on
“newborn behavioral states” led to a greater appreciation of the
human newborn as a responsive organism, capable of organized
behavior.’ Indeed, the idea of “state” was acknowledged as a critical matrix on which to assess all reactions, sensory as well as motor,
in the newborn.*”” The first behaviorally based scales for the assessment of the newborn appeared at this time. The Graham Scale and
the Graham-Rosenblith Scale were the first to attempt to outline
behavioral differences among neonates as they responded to different stimuli.'!”

Shortly after this research was published, the first iteration of the
NBAS appeared—the Cambridge Scales—which Brazelton developed along with psychologist Daniel Freedman from the University of Chicago and which he now used to test out the applicability
of the concept of individual differences in different settings.
Intrigued by the question of how children achieve competence,
Brazelton and his colleague, John Robey, went to southern Mexico,
where they used the new scale with the Zinacanteco Indians, in the
highlands of Chiapas. There Brazelton’s ideas on neonatal differences were confirmed. The two colleagues discovered that compared to their Caucasian counterparts, these infants could “pay
attention to auditory and visual signals for 30 minutes without a
break,” and their motor behavior was characterized by smooth
fluid movements.'* This research was followed by a study by
Freedman and Freedman that provided evidence for clear-cut differences between Caucasian and Chinese neonates. !4 Working with
Jerome Bruner at the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard
University and with Mary Louise Scholl from the Department of
Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital, Brazelton began to
integrate developmental theory and neurological principles into
his clinical understanding of newborn behavior and development.
Finally, in 1973, the first edition of the NBAS was published by
Spastics International Medical Publications. In the preface of that
monograph, Ronald MacKeith and Martin Bax were perceptive
when they wrote that they were “happy to predict that people will
be using and working with the NBAS for many years to come.” !°

Since then, the NBAS has become the gold standard of newborn
assessments. It has been used in many studies to examine the effects of
a wide range of pre- and perinatal variables on newborn behavior. By
the time I joined Brazelton and coauthored the NBAS, numerous studies had demonstrated that the scale was sensitive to variables, such as
the effects of intrauterine growth restriction; the prenatal ingestion of
cocaine, alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco; the exposure to environmental

## Page 202

The Brazelton Baby: The Other Side of the Coin 257
(NNNS), which aimed to take the examiner’s effects out of the
examination as much as possible in order to see the baby himself,
and not the baby with another. (But that is another story for
another time.)

Thus, it was becoming obvious that the baby revealed in the NBAS
was the baby Helena Deustch called the “real baby,” the baby that
emerges between the brittle but normal parental representational
polarities of the “perfect baby” and the “damaged baby.” The fact
that the examination brought forth the real baby meant that it
could be used to foster the development of a middle representational ground for the parents—the discovery of the real baby, their
baby. The initial approach to revealing the real baby to the parents
was to administer the full NBAS in their presence. However, the
20 to 30 minutes required to administer the exam often made it
impractical, in busy clinical settings, to routinely conduct the NBAS
for and with parents. Berry objected to the idea of a shortened
clinical examination. He felt that the examiner, who would also be
an intervener with parents, had to know both the examination and
the baby with even deeper knowledge than researchers, who had
no third parties in the room and whose role was only to administer
the exam and score it reliably, not to clinically intervene. But despite
Berry’s objection, there was an irresistible force for a shorter clinical
examination which was freer from the demands for precise scoring
and, more importantly, was directly aimed at facilitating the parentinfant relationship. Along with versions developed by others
(Cardone and Gilkerson’s Family Administered Neonatal Activities
[FANA], for example), Constance Keefer developed a version for
medical practitioners that incorporated NBAS items into the
well-child physical examination; and Kevin Nugent and Constance
Keefer and their colleagues developed a relationship-building tool,
the Newborn Behavioral Observations (NBO) system.

Berry had given the world a new kind of baby—the Brazelton
baby: an individual with capacities for self-control when distressed
and acting on, as well as taking in, the world, especially the world
of people. The NBAS was the prism for revealing the fabulous and
exciting capacities of this Brazelton baby. The baby was the promise of the future, and the NBAS strove to let us see that promise.
The Brazelton baby was Rousseauian: Left to their own devices, all
babies were capable individuals, and only the world—drugs of
abuse, obstetric medication, toxins—distorted their development.
Of course, there were the damaged babies, babies who were blind
or deaf or disfigured (all of whom we studied). But even for these
infants, something optimal could be found when the examination

## Page 203

258 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

was done well enough. To prove the point, Heidelise Als, Barry,
Berry, and I developed an examination—the Assessment of Preterm Infants’ Behavior (APIB)—for the emerging cohort of low
birth weight, then for very low birth weight, then for extremely
low birth weight neonates, and then even for micronewborns.°
With silences and whispers, gentler than gentle touches, and attention to signs of stress bordering on hypervigilance, the APIB enabled the skilled examiner to bring out these babies’ optimal selves.

A new species of baby had been discovered by Berry, and the
NBAS evolved along with it. But with the evolution of the NBAS, a
darker side of the vision of the baby has been left behind. The
Brazelton baby, as revealed by the NBAS, is full of competencies
that vary from individual to individual, profoundly influencing the
infant’s developmental trajectory, making it special and unique.
The dark side of this bright vision is simply the other side of the
competence coin: failed competencies can be pathological.

We, of course, have recognized the anomalies and medical conditions that disrupt development; but these are extreme conditions
that do not force us to question our own wished-for, perfect baby.
Those pathologies are obvious, easy to detect, and very hard to
deny. But what about functional compromises that are outside
the normal range and not so obvious? Are there functional pathologies, not simply individual variants of competencies? I believe
there are. An infant’s capabilities for Habituation, Orientation, State
Regulation, Motor Maturity, Reflexes, and Self-Consoling, and
all the other exam items, can be brilliant; but they also can be outside
the normal range—that is, pathological. I believe it is important to
think about functional pathologies, because doing so may help
us understand an often disregarded fact: most infants and young
children with mental health, neurobehavioral and neuropsychological problems were clinically normal newborns. It seems to me that
these clinically healthy newborns must have brought something to
development that was already a nascent problem—something that
would emerge full-blown over time regardless of caretaking, or
something pathological and hard to see that would distort development and seriously distort even the best of caretaking.

What are the pathologic effects of functional compromises?
Problems of functional capacities—pathologies—can be thought of
as having four potential pathologic effects: energy wastage, loss of
function, experience disruption, and disruption of the ability to
make sense of the world. These four different pathologic effects are
always tightly coupled and, at best, can only be conceptually
separated.

## Page 204

The Brazelton Baby: The Other Side of the Coin 259

The first effect of functional compromises is wasting energy.
There are at least two forms of this energy wastage. One occurs
when the newborn is doing something that has no function; a compromise of attention, for example, leads to looking aimlessly from
target to target. Energy is expended for no purpose. The second
form of energy wasting occurs when one disrupted function in
turn disrupts other normal functions (e.g., the failure to habituate
disrupts attentional processes). Again, energy is wasted. Together,
then, combined forms of energy wasting are self-amplifying. Als,
in addition to pointing out the costs of external impingements,
especially those in our NICUs, has strongly pointed toward the
costs in wasted energy that can be traced to failures of the infant’s
endogenous systems.

The second effect of functional compromises is loss of function.
The infant cannot do something—cannot shut down responsding
to inconsequential events or cannot maintain attention. This is a
functional pathology in and of itself. In addition, it is likely to disrupt
other functions.

The third effect of functional compromises is that it disrupts the
infant’s ability to utilize experience for growth and development.
There are two forms of this pathology. First, there is a failure of
self-organization. For example, a functional pathology for selfregulating motor movements leads to a disruption of an infant’s
ability to organize his body in the service of looking. Second, there
is a social failure. The infant’s functional deficit disrupts the flow of
growth-promoting experiences and regulation that would otherwise
be provided by caretakers. For example, if the infant’s irritability
threshold is pathologically low, not only is the infant disrupted by
normal social engagement, but caretakers’ efforts to engage the
baby further are also disrupted.

There is yet another form of pathology that is more difficult to
specify. Nonetheless, I think it may be critical. It is a pathology in
the capacity of the infant to form states of consciousness for making
sense of the world and his or place in it. These states have nothing
to do with awareness or self-reflection. Most sense making is out of
awareness and is implicit. The notion of sense making is built on
Jerome Bruner’s idea that humans are meaning makers. Infants,
even newborns, attempt to make sense of the world in an agepossible way. We cannot fathom their sense making, but I believe
they are attempting to implicitly come to know how they relate to
the world. For example, they do not look at an object because it is
novel or brightly red. Rather they explore it to figure out the sense
of it in relation to themselves, to act on it in some way. We can see

## Page 205

260 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

newborns express their intention as their fingers take shape or they
make a swipe at the ball. Trevarthen has observed how infants
shape their mouths and express air when looking at faces, and he
sees these responses as intentions, as attempts to communicate.
There are other examples: think of Meltzoff and Field’s demonstrations of imitation. I am not sure what the age-possible intention
or meaning making of an infant is in each of these contexts. I am,
however, sure the infant is making some sense of these experiences
as evidenced by his expenditure of an enormous amount of energy
and control to organize his actions. When the capacity to make
sense of the world goes awry, we can conceptualize it as a pathology
of consciousness. It is a compromise of the infant’s embodied brain
to make sense of the relation between him- or herself and events.
Such a pathology is truly a psychopathology and one that will have
profound effects on development. For example, one need only
think of a newborn whose ability to make sense of a human face
and voice is compromised and the developmental consequences of
such a pathology.

Thinking about functional behavioral pathologies in infancy, in
the context of a discussion of the NBAS, may strike some as “pathologic.” After all, the NBAS is the search for infant competencies
and individuality. But actually, I think the idea is not so odd. The
competent infant can also be the incompetent infant, the pathologic
infant. Lieberman’s “Angels in the Nursery” are the other side of
the coin of Fraiberg’s “Ghosts in the Nursery.” It may seem that to
think of incompetencies as pathologies and as having pathologic
effects on development is too extreme; perhaps—but only perhaps.
Allow me to present a dynamic process view of how behavioral
functional incompetencies can have pathologic effects. And let us
have no straw persons in this account. We will put aside the kinds
of frank bodily pathologies (loss of limbs, brain lesions) and frank
functional pathologies (no capacity for habituation, no arousal
regulation) that most certainly lead to pathologic outcomes. Instead,
let’s focus on a pathologic function that is simply outside normal
functional parameters and even somewhat limited and specific:
a very low threshold to stimulation that leads to a defensive
motor or startle reaction, a kind of jumpy baby. How can this
compromise of functional capacities act pathologically, that is, act
to disrupt development and lead to a pathologic outcome?

The impact of this pathologic threshold is fourfold: energetic
effects, loss of function, disruptive effect on self-organizing and
engagement with others, and loss of implicit meaning making.
For example, an infant with a low threshold to stimulation will

## Page 206

The Brazelton Baby: The Other Side of the Coin 261
waste energy, reacting with a defensive startle to the merest of
stimuli, possibly including the infant’s own movements. He becomes
overly aroused, cannot attend to and assimilate needed brainnurturing stimulation, and is unable to participate in regulatory
and growth-promoting interactions. The experience is chaotic, and
he can make no sense of it. Of course the initial costs of this singular,
functionally deficient threshold may be low; but each of its impacts
and their synergistic effects are self-amplifying. As a result, more and
more energy is wasted; arousal becomes increasingly heightened;
interactions are increasingly disrupted; and experience is chaotic
and damagingly out of control. Furthermore, even if it is the case
that with self-amplification the costs are low, the millions of chronic,
reiterated small costs of engaging and being in the world moment
by moment will accumulate over time into an enormous cost; that
is, into a pathologic outcome.

It is important to note that these pathologies of energy and
function, experience and meaning making may be extremely subtle
and hard to detect in infancy. One cannot easily see how energy is
being wasted or a functional capacity is outside the normal range.
It is not possible to see a social pathology that distorts parenting
until parenting is actually distorted; and then we face our own
biases about who caused what. More subtle still is a pathology
of consciousness, because the infant has so few ways to express
his implicit meanings about the world, and we have such a difficult time fathoming the infant’s meanings. The subtleties of
pathologies of consciousness may explain why we do not see them
as problems, yet their subtlety of expression does not minimize their
profound cost.

Thus, putting aside the frank anomalies of body and function,
I believe that some significant number of “normal” children who later
turn out pathological actually had unrecognized pathologies at
birth that disrupted and distorted development. These pathologies
may well arise from fetal epigenetic processes. Such an assertion in
no way denies the significance of abnormal environments and
other toxic processes that distort the development of a normal
infant; but because we have so emphasized these latter processes
and their impact on the wonders of the infant, we have failed to
look carefully enough for functional pathologies inherent in a
newborn. In addition, think how hard it is to recognize this sort
of pathology. It is so “minor.” Even if we do notice it, by the time
we wait to see if the infant outgrows it (which in some instances
may occur), it is likely to transform itself and create other problems
(e.g., a low habituation threshold transforming itself into sleep

## Page 207

262 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

disruption and growth problems or problems of attention). Once
this cascade of effects begins, the initial cause will be gone from our
vision. Nonetheless, there was an initial cause, and we will have
missed it, only to see at some later point in development a baby
who was clinically normal who is now severely compromised.
Thus, we need to continue to develop ways of seeing the functional
pathologies of infants. The small problems of the moment need to
be taken seriously, and their consequences in the immediate short
run carefully sought after.

The NBAS examination has changed our understanding of
infancy. In working with Berry, I was—and I still am—amazed at
what he can see and how he can convey his seeing to others. Few
experiences match up to being with Berry when he examines an
infant in front of parents who suddenly see who their baby is—a he
or ashe, not an it—for the very first time. In the future, Nugent and
Keefer’s use of Brazelton’s core concepts for work with parents will
surely be elaborated upon. Indeed, these programs are beginning
to reach more and more parents, something sorely needed. A great
need, one already presaged by parts of the NBAS, is to develop an
examination that looks at how the infant affects his caretakers
and how he acts on the world and utilizes the effects of his
actions to grow. It might be thought of as an examination of
Dan Siegel’s interpersonal brain. Unfortunately, there is a need to
look carefully for the dark side, with more sensitive elaborations,
such as the NNNS examination, that look at the infant qua infant
and seek to see competencies and incompetencies. Such examinations or ways of looking must seek to identify cascading pathologic
effects that generate an abnormal outcome in the thought-to-be
normal infant.

The NBAS exam was never really only an exam, a static thing.
It actually was—and is—a vigorous ongoing process that is
developing still. This process will lead to our seeing both sides,
indeed all sides, of the baby; that is, the whole baby—the baby that
Berry always envisioned.

CHAPTER 25
Evolving Family Dynamics
and Neonatal Assessment
BONNIE J. PETRAUSKAS

For more than 2 decades, I have had the privilege of working
with health-care professionals and medical organizations striving
to achieve improved health-care outcomes for babies. The focus
of this effort has been the design and implementation of programs
that promote safe, healthy pregnancies and deliveries for all women
and infants around the world. An important goal, understandably,
is to build capacity of the health-care infrastructure to ensure
sustainability. My own role has been to facilitate multidisciplinary
collaborations in the widest imaginable variety of settings. And my
experiences in this role have convinced me that by pooling resources
and sharing expertise, medical professionals and their industry
partners can help today’s families successfully address whatever
health-care challenges they may encounter.

Every baby born is a reaffirmation of hope, promise, and possibilities. Each of us bears a responsibility to help all babies thrive, so
they can grow up and lead healthy, productive lives. By sharing
ideas, knowledge, and resources, we will be able to foster the
exchange of scientific and medical research, generate initiatives
that address critical needs in child health, and create resources that
support parents.

With infant and family health as an overarching long-term goal,
this is an exciting time to consider the importance of neonatal
behavior and the role of neonatal behavioral assessment in contemporary pediatric care. Whether we approach this topic as scientists
and researchers, as health-care professionals, as industry partners,
or simply as concerned members of society, we are confronted with
one irrefutable fact: In the twenty-first century, babies are born into
264

Evolving Family Dynamics and Neonatal Assessment 265

a far wider spectrum of family circumstances than in any previous
generation. Yet, regardless of shifting and evolving social structures
over time, there is one constant: The central focus of every family
remains on the baby. While a large percentage of today’s newborns
are being cared for by new kinds of families, many of the tools used
to examine neonatal behavior, including the Neonatal Behavioral
Assessment Scale (NBAS), date from the 1960s. Forty years ago, the
predominant family structure in Western societies was the classic
nuclear family—both biological parents living with their children.
In today’s industrialized societies, the number of all types of nontraditional families is increasing. In the United States, for example,
single-parent families, due to any number of circumstances—divorce,
military service, employment considerations, drug addiction, or
incarceration—are now common. At present, it is estimated that
between 50% and 75% of children will spend some time in a singleparent family.' In fact, about a third of children are now born into a
single-mother family, representing a steady increase over recent
decades (Figure 25.1).*°

Early work in the 1960s by Spock, Brazelton, and other experts
had a positive impact on improving approaches to infant care.
Berry Brazelton’s work showed that every neonate was unique and
that the newborn was an active partner in a relationship with his or
her caregiver from the very beginning.* At the time of Brazelton’s
earliest writings, mothers generally stayed at home with their
babies, the term “caregiver” was synonymous with “mother,” and

so child guidance and caregiving guidelines were directed primarily
at mothers. Today, nearly three quarters of mothers work, presumably
outside the home.° In recent years, four times as many women
returned to work in the first few months of their babies’ lives as did
in the 1960s.°
CHANGING FAMILY STRUCTURES
AND NEONATAL CARE
There have been other important changes in family structure and
in family dynamics since the 1960s—an increase in father-only
families, an increase in the number of children living with relatives
other than their biological parents, and an increase in the number
of babies entering foster care.’ Also, there have been dramatic
increases in international, interracial, and cross-cultural adoptions
in North America, resulting in family groupings that are essentially
unique. Consider some of the homecomings that exist today for
newborns after discharge from the hospital. It is quite possible that
the neonate’s primary caregiver may not be his biological mother,
but a parent or grandparent of the mother (possibly still just a teenager), a member of the mother’s extended or blended family, the
domestic partner or spouse of a biological or adoptive parent, or, of
course, a professional child-care worker. Besides international and
interracial adoption, social trends such as same-sex couples, fathers
who stay home to parent while mothers go off to work, and surrogate motherhood push the concept of what constitutes a family far
beyond the definitions that existed in the 1960s. All of these situations
give us invaluable opportunities to broaden the impact of neonatal
assessment and intervention to support families in an increasingly
stressful world. We already have the tools to evaluate newborn
behavior, but we now need to apply them in a way that brings
families together, no matter what their make up.
EXPANDING AND ADAPTING
FAMILY-CENTERED CARE
All those involved in neonatal assessment and intervention—from
health-care professionals and social care experts to providers and
industry partners—need to collaborate in embracing the work of
the research community. This means (as Rachel Keen points out
in this volume) translating research findings into clinical work
with infants and families and fostering the integration of neonatal

polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); the effects of different modes of
delivery; or the effects of prematurity. The NBAS also stimulated the
development of a number of assessment scales for use with different
populations and in different settings, a testament to its theoretical richness and its generativity. Heidelise Als, Barry Lester, Berry Brazelton,
and Ed Tronick, for example, used the concepts of the NBAS to develop
the Assessment of Preterm Infants’ Behavior (APIB).'° Barry Lester
and Ed Tronick also used the NBAS as the basis for the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), which
was designed for the neurobehavioral assessment of drug-exposed
and other high-risk infants, especially preterm infants. !°

While the NBAS has been used in hundreds of research studies
as an outcome measure and continues to be used as a means of
assessing pre- and perinatal influences on newborn behavior, we
began to realize, in the 1980s, that the NBAS was a powerful teaching tool and could be used as a form of intervention. A series of
studies, summarized by Nugent and Brazelton,!”'®'? showed that
demonstrating the newborn infant’s behavioral capacities to parents can serve as a mechanism for helping parents learn about their
new infant, thereby strengthening the relationship between parent
and child and supporting family adjustment. Specifically, a number
of studies consistently have reported positive effects of exposure to
the NBAS on variables such as maternal confidence and self-esteem,
paternal attitudes toward and involvement in caregiving, parentinfant interaction, and developmental outcome.

Just as the NBAS was adapted to assess different at-risk populations, as in the case of the APIB and the NNNS, it has also been
adapted or modified to render it more effective as a teaching tool
for parents. A number of approaches based on the NBAS were
developed for use in clinical environments as a form of parent education or intervention. The first of these modifications was by
Tiffany Field and her colleagues who developed the Mother’s
Assessment of the Behavior of the Infant.2? The Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP)
training process, developed by Heidelise Als, has profoundly
changed the way in which neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
staff, particularly nurses, are trained in the observation and care of
the premature infant.”! By incorporating behavioral items and concepts from the NBAS into the routine physical pediatric examination, Constance Keefer developed the Combined Physical Exam
and Behavioral Exam (PEBE),”* while Jodo Carlos Gomes-Pedro
and his colleagues, in their efforts to sensitize parents to the behavior of their newborns, effectively tested a shortened version of the

Evolving Family Dynamics and Neonatal Assessment 267
assessment into everyday practice. We all have our individual roles
in achieving this objective. As researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and parent advocates alike, we need to work together to
produce a body of evidence on neonatal behavior and early parentinfant interaction that can be applied across the current wide spectrum of family structures. Hard data delineating proven outcomes
will carry great weight in grassroots acceptance of neonatal assessment and early intervention.

As medical advances yield an ever larger and more diverse
neonatal population, the need for effective early intervention
increases. Many more low birthweight and premature infants, as
well as babies of drug-addicted or alcoholic mothers, survive in
the twenty-first century than did in the 1960s (Figures 25.2 and
25.3).°% Reports estimate that 90% of premature infants in the
United States, including those born as early as 24 weeks, now
survive. This is due to the dramatic advances in medical care following the establishment of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
(NICU) in the 1960s and the development of neonatal medicine
as a specialty in the 1970s.’

In the early days of their lives, these infants may have substantially more contact and interaction with health-care professionals
than with their mothers. Are these babies at risk, even though they
are receiving competent care, as the result of their mothers’
restricted caregiving role during hospitalization?

CHALLENGES FACING THE
INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER
The increasingly diversified spectrum of family life means new
challenges for providers. Contemporary clinicians must be able to
conduct the right kind of evaluation at the right time and place. In
addition, they must adapt their current, evidence-based practices
to support not only the full range of family structures they encounter, but also the wide array of cultural beliefs and traditions that
coexist among the families they care for. While there may be no
cookie-cutter solution to assessing families with different backgrounds, the one reliable common denominator will be the baby—
still at the center of family life across the social spectrum.

Now, more than ever, neonatal assessment has a pivotal role to
play, and the assessment process continues to evolve to meet the
needs of families in changing times. For instance, in response to
the limited time that health-care professionals are able to spend
with parents, new tools such as the Newborn Behavioral Observations (NBO) were inspired by the NBAS and designed to meet the
needs of health-care professionals in contemporary settings (see
Chapter 11). Another version of the NBAS has been created specifically to evaluate the behavior of preterm babies. Undoubtedly,
assessment tools will continue to be adapted to reflect new learning

## Page 215

Evolving Family Dynamics and Neonatal Assessment 269
about newborns, their shifting family structures, and their changing
home environments.

INTEGRATING TECHNOLOGY INTO

THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS
The fact that the health-care environment has become increasingly
technological may be a cultural factor in itself. Expense permitting,
researchers and practitioners now have access to a wide array of
tools that were nonexistent in the early days of behavioral research.
Diagnostic imaging equipment can track brain and neurological
activity; other noninvasive devices produce objective indices of
neurobehavior, which Daniel Stern and Nadia Bruschweiler-Stern
discuss in Chapter 26. These amazing technological advances
provide broader choices for clinical evaluation than ever before.
Nevertheless, they may pose another complication, a phenomenon
that John Kennell also addresses in Chapter 23. Diagnosticians and
researchers must decide which investigative method should be
used and why. A system that allows researchers and practitioners to evaluate the tools at their disposal and choose the right
combination for each particular case is needed. At the same time,
the tools selected must be able to capture what is contextually
meaningful to health-care professionals and to the health-care
system.

Integrating the results of behavioral assessments with the
quantitative results of other objectively verifiable data will be
extremely important as we face the future. Fortunately, our assessment tools already provide the foundation for an organized, coherent
approach to help reconcile the data from multiple sources. A comprehensive, formalized method based on this model could have a
major impact on the health-care system as a whole, eventually
gaining wide acceptance and routine usage in providers’ offices.
As a result, neurobehavioral assessment could become more mainstream, greatly increasing parents’ access to neonatal assessment
for their babies.

ASSESSMENT AS A RELATIONSHIP-BUILDING
TOOL: NEW POSSIBILITIES
While a primary goal of neonatal assessment is to create an optimally
healthy environment for the newborn, the impact of this work
extends beyond the infant to the caregiver. Sensitizing the parents
or primary caregivers to their baby’s competencies and preferences

## Page 216

270 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE
reduces their stress about looking after their newborn, improves
their emotional well-being, and thereby ultimately benefits the
baby. A series of studies dating from the 1980s shows that demonstrating a neonate’s behavioral responses to parents during the
assessment has a positive influence on parental behavior.'° Most
researchers conclude that participation by parents in the assessment process strengthens parent-child relationships. It also helps
the family make a smoother transition through the psychosocial
changes that inevitably accompany the birth of a baby. As Worobey
and Brazelton stated in a commentary, “[Assessment] should be
used as a tool for reaching out to new parents via the universal
language of the baby.”!°

Clearly, what parents learn about their newborn during assessment empowers them as caregivers. Building on this finding, it
would be interesting to observe parents’ responses to the results of
their babies’ assessments as documented by noninvasive medical
imaging and other modern technological tools. Parents or other
primary caregivers could literally see for themselves how quantitative values or medical images improve as they have more frequent
and positive interactions with their babies. It seems safe to conclude
that if we find ways to increase parental or primary caregiver
involvement in the evaluation process, we can further enhance the
developmental environment for the newborn and simultaneously
create an even more satisfying experience for the caregivers.

SHARING COMMITMENT, SPREADING THE WORD

By studying the impact of newborn assessment techniques on family
functioning, we can advance family-centered care and demonstrate
its effectiveness. The opportunity now exists to extend the use of
neonatal behavioral assessments to a wider variety of practices and
apply them in a more systematic, but family-centered, way. K. A.
Moore and colleagues have stated, “Family-centered care is more
of a journey than a destination,” noting that collaborative practices
all around the world find themselves at different stages along
the path." Continued research into the impact of the family on the
neonate, and vice versa, will further efforts of health-care professionals striving to help families respond to the challenge of a new
baby, particularly if the baby has special needs. As the American
Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Early Childhood, Adoption,
and Dependent Care has firmly declared, “All families need knowledge, skills, and support to raise their children and to foster normal
growth, development and learning.”

## Page 217

Evolving Family Dynamics and Neonatal Assessment 271
LOOKING AHEAD: WHAT CAN WE EXPECT
FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR?

Industries that partner with health-care organizations and practitioners can play a valuable role in a number of ways. The most
obvious is by integrating new knowledge and responding to
changing needs as they develop and modify their products and
services. Equally important, industry can leverage their public
relations resources in creative and supportive ways—disseminating
new data in neonatal research and assessment to the broader
community of health-care professionals, educating parents, and
optimizing advocacy initiatives. For instance, in addition to facilitating researcher-practitioner communications, industry can
enhance provider-parent communications through patient brochures, web site content, educational videos, DVDs or downloadable computer files and professional education in the form of
grand rounds, continuing education credits, training offerings and
curriculum development.

Looking to the future, we can expect that improving communication skills—and the exchange of information between provider
and parent—will help improve health-care outcomes. This must be
part of a long-term strategy that includes bringing about greater
integration of neonatal behavioral assessment into health-care
practice, as well as strengthening assessment skills through the
medical school curriculum. Seeding this kind of future involves a
huge collaborative effort. It is not enough for experts to work in
small isolated groups, or for industry to play a limited role. Experts
must find ways to expand their wisdom to a wider audience, and
industry can help. There is already a steady and growing momentum to encourage greater understanding of neonatal behavior
among frontline health-care providers. Strategies advocated by the
World Health Organization (WHO) to improve child survival,
growth, and development call for increased family involvement.”
A key theme of these guidelines is the need for close contact
between the neonate and all those actively involved in his care—
the mother, father, and other caregivers. The World Health Organization calls for families to be educated, motivated, and supported
so that they can give appropriate care to their newborns.

Today’s parents face many stressors, not the least of which is the
overwhelming avalanche of information on the subjects of newborn care and child development. Health-care professionals educated in a strength-based approach to neonatal assessment and
intervention can help by providing parents with accurate, consistent,
and personalized information about their children. By focusing on

## Page 218

272 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

the baby, providers can help unite the family and provide support

for parents to meet the developmental needs of their infants. Since

family relationships are critical to healthy development, parents
and newborns will benefit through positive interactions and
meaningful shared moments.

CHAPTER 26
Future Dialogue between the
Neurosciences and the
Behavioral Observation
of Infants
DANIEL N. STERN anp NADIA BRUSCHWEILER-STERN

It is clear that the neurosciences will play a greater role in the future
of the field of infancy. In fact, this role has already begun. One of the
challenges for the exploding field of neuroscience research is to choose
questions that are interesting to ask—interesting for developmental
psychology, for psychology in general, for clinical purposes, and for
understanding human nature. To do this, the neurosciences must
look at real behavior as observed in daily life, in clinical situations,
and in certain experimental situations that are based on real life. With
new methods of research at hand, the arts/sciences of observation
and behavioral analysis are not doomed to the historical past. Rather
they have become reanimated as the future source of questions for
the evolving tools of the neurosciences. Behavioral observation is, in
fact, the ultimate interlocutor and dialogic partner for the neurosciences. The work of Berry Brazelton is such a source. The Neonatal
Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) can serve as an example.

For instance, what happens in the newborn's brain when he turns
his head toward his mother’s voice and looks into her eyes as they
are looking into his? And just as fascinating, what happens in the
mother’s brain at the same moment? This is an almost routine occurrence
during the performance of the NBAS when it is done with the
active participation of the parents. Whatever happens in the brains
of newborn and mother at this moment will open up the inquiry
into love, affiliation, attachment, and their origins. It will also ask

273

## Page 220

274 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

about the beginnings of intersubjectivity—the participation of
one individual in the experience of another. (In saying this,
we do not imagine that behavior, and particularly the subjective
experiences that accompany behavior, can be reduced to the neuronal level of analysis—or explained away. Rather, that a dialogue
between the two levels of analysis will open up each domain to its
own future.)

A consideration of this double question—what happens in the
baby’s and mother’s brains during the first, second, nth mutual
gaze?—requires some discussion. Such a moment of mutual gaze
does not happen every time the infant responds to environmental
stimulation. It may only happen once during the administration of
the NBAS, or in a spontaneous interaction. It is not a truly controllable experimental variable, even though it can often be promoted.
In any event, it does happen, and we are convinced that it can
happen. (In a similar way, to be unshakably convinced that a bird
can fly, you need to see only one do it, while the rest stay on the
ground.) We are aided here by Brazelton’s notion of “optimal
performance.” Much wisdom went into Brazelton’s decision to
score for optimal performance on the items of the NBAS, even
though some will note that it makes for a messier field of study
and runs counter to the experimental tendency to control all the
possible variables.

Brazelton’s notion of optimal performance is in tune with the
current paradigm that finds that nonlinear, noncausal dynamic
systems theories provide the most adequate descriptions of naturally occurring, spontaneous, self-organizing processes. In this
view the moment of mutual gaze, and whatever it does in the
two brains, is an emergent property of a very complex system.
One of the problems with studying these relatively infrequent
phenomena is that it is impossible to predict whether they will
happen at all, exactly when they will happen, and the exact form
they will take—a dynamite mutual gaze, or just a so-so one. One
cannot forget that so many of the revealing, even wondrous, interactions that occur between parent and infant are spontaneous and,
accordingly, unpredictable. With the practice of scoring for optimal performance, Brazelton has positioned his work to take advantage of the dynamic systems theory models that will prove more
useful as we explore the unpredictable, emergent phenomena in a
baby’s life.

There is a second consideration that this example raises. What
goes into a moment that lasts only several seconds and is surrounded by a sea of other behaviors and events that preceded and

## Page 221

Future Dialogue between the Neurosciences 275
followed it? And here we enter another portal into the future that
Brazelton’s work has opened. This kind of mutual gaze is not
simply another event. We insist that it has its own separate value.
It is a micro-[ouchpoint—a privileged moment that other events
will turn on. In fact, the whole relationship may turn on it.

When looked at this way, this moment invites us to enter into it
more deeply. It is not an event in the sense of a tick on a behavioral
scale—on or off, it happened or not. It is a drama, albeit a microdrama, that unfolds during the time the mutual gaze lasts, and its
affective echo continues to reverberate afterward. This takes several
seconds to happen, even many. The event has its own duration, its
own passage in time. During that stretch of time, future brain imaging
will show the patterned temporal progression of neural activity
from one brain region to another, with crescendos then decrescendos of neural activity in different regions, each having its own peak
time and time profile. All of this activity will look something like a
musical score that unfolds in real time in the brain. And the mind?
The overall neural patterning, the melody and rhythm—so to
speak—of the whole moment will describe a time line, a temporal
gestalt, that becomes inscribed, at the level of mind, as the representation of the lived event for the baby and mother.'

In the future, we will have to take the temporal dimension of
experience much more into account. Up until now, timing has been
mainly ignored. It has been sufficient to time behaviors as occurring
before, during, or after a reference event, and not to examine the
diachronic (temporal) unfolding of the reference event. But it is
likely to be exactly there, in the details of temporal patterning, that
the mind forms representations from the activity of neural circuits.
We first study musical forms and only later digital sequences. And
if we are indeed studying the complex melodic line of experience,
are we not studying microemotional narratives—microstories
with a beginning, a middle, and an end? The future should make
such studies possible. But observations at the level of behavior, as
happens during an NBAS exam, will remain the referent.

Berry Brazelton has helped this forward movement by focusing
on the small, local behaviors between infant and examiner. For it is
in these small occurrences that life is lived, and from them all else
that is mental arises—the schemas, the concepts, the representations,
the relationships.

Moving to other examples, still confining ourselves to the NBAS,
what happens in the brain as habituation proceeds? Are the neural
activation patterns the same for visual as well as for auditory
habituation? Are they the same for any and all stimuli, or are they

## Page 222

276 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

different for human stimuli? Do they all use the same mechanisms?
What happens when the baby molds herself to the caregiver’s
body? Is there an initial wave of feeling with the start of tactile
contact? Is there then a “sinking-in” phase? And afterward, is there
a steady state phase? Does that prepare the way for another kind of
brain/mental activity to start up, while the tactile contact continues? What other affiliative behaviors create similar neural patterns?
Are we watching the beginning of the developmental line of
attachment? Or another motive system? Is there something unique
about ventro-ventral contact? Should it be considered a major
motivational goal state? Does it deactivate one state and lead to a
new one? Does mutual gaze have this same unique status? And
shared laughter? And mutual smiling? Do we need to rewrite part
of the book on motive systems in babies and adults? Their aims
and the specific activities that permit them to achieve their aims?
And if we did, where would we start? With mutual gaze? With
ventro-ventral contact? With laughter? Mutual gaze is the most
direct path to the other’s soul. Ventro-ventral contact is the
most direct path to the other’s heart. And laughter is the most direct
path to the other’s mind. Might these starting places take us
further in clinical theoretical understanding than starting with
hunger and sucking, or with perception and cognition?

The future promises to see the development of imaging techniques
that can deal with what is happening in two separate interacting
brains simultaneously, or three (including the father), and to treat
them as one system. This has already started to happen. Such
techniques will help unlock many of the mysteries of the developing nature of intersubjectivity, and of the nature of “maternal”
attributions and feelings.

In short, the work of Berry Brazelton has helped form a solid
base for our current understandings. Even more, his work may
well guide and provide ideas for our field in its future dialogues
with the neurosciences.

INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON RESEARCH,

EARLY INTERVENTION, AND TRAINING
The chapters that follow represent many disciplines from many
countries and examine the effects of different perinatal and cultural
influences on behavior and the relationship between newborn
behavior and later outcome. These studies also attest to the shift in
emphasis toward intervention that begins ever earlier in the child’s
life. These reports embrace an approach to children and families
that eschews the classic deficit-seeking medical model and is committed instead to interventions that are both family-centered and
relationship-based.

One of the questions that continues to challenge theorists,
researchers, public policymakers, and educational planners is
whether there is a relationship between newborn behavior and
later development, especially in the case of high-risk infants. Karin
Stjernqvist from the University of Lund in Sweden examines the
relationship between newborn behavior and later developmental
outcomes in her longitudinal study, “Predicting Development for
Extremely Low Birthweight Infants” (Chapter 2) In this chapter,
she reports a positive correlation between the newborn orientation
capacities at term, Developmental Quotient (DQ) at 4 years of age,
and IQ at 10 years, despite the fact that in the neonatal period,
instability in physical, physiological, and behavioral systems is
pronounced, and neonatal assessments are thought to be less
predictive.

The sensitivity of the NBAS as an outcome measure has been
demonstrated in numerous studies conducted by Tiffany Field and

The Role of the Neonatal
Behavioral Assessment Scale:
Personal Reflections
T. BERRY BRAZELTON

In the 1950s when the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale
(NBAS) was first conceived, professionals didn’t believe that newborn babies could see or hear. Of course, every parent knew better.
A pregnant mother had experienced her fetus’s reactions to sudden,
loud noises and to bright lights. But our conviction that nature provided a new baby as a “lump of clay,” to be shaped by nurture was
so powerful that when anything went wrong, we “blamed the victim’”—the parent. As a pediatrician, I witnessed daily the result of
this success or failure mentality as I saw the suffering and guilt
of parents of special needs children—such as those with autistic
spectrum disorders or dysgenetic defects. The parents were ready
to take the blame and resort to years of therapy. But guilt and therapy weren’t the answer. I could see that these babies brought their
own dysfunctions along with them into the world, and our medical
interventions were not able to change them easily. I began to
wonder whether these children contributed in a major way to
their own failures because I could see that no matter how wellintentioned their parents were, the likelihood of dysfunction was
great. I wanted to find a way to assess the baby’s contribution at
birth, thus alleviating parental guilt and improving parents’ likelihood of seeing the baby as a person. I saw the baby’s progress as
an interaction between nature and nurture—not just an exclusive
function of nurture.

I searched for the few infant researchers who believed in a
neonate’s contribution to his own development. Sally Provence at
278

## Page 227

The Role of the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale 279
the Yale Child Study Center was well known for her ability to
interact with newborns and to bring out wonderful responses in
them. I went to see her play with newborn babies. As she picked up
a newborn, she tilted the swaddled infant into a semi-upright position. She danced; she sang softly; she twirled. The baby became her
partner in a pas de deux. They seemed to blend into each other,
almost becoming one smoothly interacting creature. The newborn’s
eyes came open. Sally smiled gently. The newborn alerted to her
softly singing voice. As Sally twirled, the newborn became even
more alert, following her face with his eyes, and moving his head
back and forth as in a love fest. The baby arched toward her, turned to
her. His hands and feet reached out for Sally. I was fascinated.

I blurted out, “Sally, it looks as if you have been able to get inside
that baby’s brain.”

Sally smiled gently in reply, “Well, there’s a baby’s brain inside
of each of us, isn’t there?”

Inspired by her recognition of the baby’s responsiveness, I began
to look for ways of assessing the baby’s capacities. I was well aware
of Heinz Prechtl’s research, in which he had identified the limits of
“normal” motor behavior in a neurological evaluation. He had
established a recognition of six states of alertness (sleep, REM sleep,
indeterminate, wide awake alertness, fussy, and crying).' Within
each of these, motor behavior differed. It seemed that state was a
precondition of the baby’s ability to respond. Motor activity dominated by newborn reflex behavior interfered with quiet alertness.
Dr. Gerald Stechler from Boston University and I were able to demonstrate by EEG that repeated intrusive light stimuli consistently
induced a sleep-like state in newborns. This built on our conclusion
of state as the basis for all newborn choices to respond or to shut out
stimuli. It was beginning to be obvious that the newborn baby could
protect himself from visual or auditory overstimulation by a habituated (sleep-like) state. It was also becoming evident that a state of
alertness demanded an appropriate state of consciousness, with relative motor inactivity, and that startle and reflex motor activity
could interfere with such a state. Hence, the newborn began to
reveal himself as a carefully programmed organism for which certain specific, identifiable states of consciousness were the required
base for responsiveness. Handling the newborn in certain ways
could produce these appropriate states, as I had seen in observing
how Dr. Provence interacted with newborns. Watching her produce
the marvelous variability in responses that an infant was capable of
reminded me of the first time I had worn goggles underwater to see
the amazing array of fish just under the surface.

280 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

The neonate’s motor responses were well documented, but
I began to see that they served a purpose to him. Although they
appeared to be driven by reflex motor behavior, these responses
proved to be more complex and symbolized his efforts to control
his responses to his environment. They were especially rewarding
to an observer who was trying to understand the neonate’s competence, as well as his temperament (style of interacting). First,
I noticed that the neonate could bring his hand to his mouth, or
would try to. Second, I noted the more exciting self-protective
responses—how he would turn his head when placed on his
stomach to protect his airway, bat away a cloth placed over his face,
calm down to thumb-suck when offered a voice or a face while he
was in a crying state. These all spoke to the competence of the newborn. In addition, he would hold his head up in the sitting position;
he had a walk reflex and the squirming Gallant reflex; he quieted
down when I placed him belly down over my forearm in a football hold. Parents were excited and intrigued by all of these
reflex-driven responses.

These were built-in responses at birth. Further, I discovered that
if I could contain the startle reflex by holding his arm with one
thumb, tilt him up to 30 degrees, and rock him gently until his eyes
opened, he would fix his gaze on and follow a red ball—or my
face—moving back and forth, up and down. He would turn to a
soft rattle or my voice and follow them for a prolonged alert period.
It seemed as if, once engaged, he worked hard to maintain an alert
state, just as he had worked in sleep to keep himself under control.
Held up against my shoulder, he hid at first, but after a few
moments, he’d lift his head to look around; then, making himself
comfortable, he’d nestle his soft scalp in the corner of my neck.
When he was crying lustily, he’d begin to quiet if I spoke softly
in his ear, or held his arms so he couldn’t startle over and over
(the crying itself seemed to produce an upset crying state), or, if
necessary, held and cuddled him, and even gave him a nipple to
suck on. All of these responses could be graded and seemed to give
the observer (and parent) a window into the type of baby he might
be for them.

These observations became the basis of my clinical version of the
Neonatal Behavioral Scale. I first used it in studies in Southern
Mexico, with the Zinacanteco Indians, a Mayan tribe in the highlands
of Chiapas. There, we saw that in their appearance the newborn
babies were like the Asian babies I studied later.” At birth, they were
very quiet, gently and gracefully moving with all extremities. Along
with or because of low-keyed motor activity, they paid attention to

auditory and visual signals for 30 minutes without a break. A Caucasian newborn, by contrast, will get excited after 3 to 5 minutes,
throwing off a startle that interferes with his ability to maintain his
attention. While I was in Mexico, Dr. Philip Sapir, a representative
of the W. T. Grant Foundation, accompanied me as we climbed
from one mountainous village to another. He was so taken with the
richness of the Assessment that he offered to fund the work toward
its publication. Ten years later, that became a reality. It was first
published in 1973.°

Before it was in a form to be published, I attempted, as a clinician,
to set up a system of scoring—good, better, best. My colleagues,
Dan Freedman of Chicago and Francis Horowitz of Kansas, urged
me to describe each score, so that there could be reliability among
observers. The discipline of describing each item and each numerical score within each item became a powerful window into observing the baby’s behavior more carefully. This scoring led to reliability
among observers and convinced pediatric researchers and practitioners everywhere that we were developing a scale that could be
an extremely useful tool for assessment.*

Meanwhile, allowing parents to observe this assessment
became a powerful way of confirming the parents’ own observations and knowledge of their newborn baby. We dreamed of its being
used by clinicians to share insights about the baby with new parents
and support their passion for getting to know their new baby—one
of the fundamental steps toward attachment. Numerous papers
have subsequently confirmed this use of the Scale in fostering
attachment and providing parents with the understanding of their
child that’s so necessary to optimal nurturing.*

Many contributors helped bring the NBAS to fruition. From
the first, in 1973, Ronald MacKeith of London was our godfather
in printing it as a book. When his company, MacKeith Press,
undertook its publication, all of us involved with the project
doubted that it would ever pay for itself. Even so, it seemed like
a worthwhile venture. I was invited to Oxford University by
Dr. Peter Tizard to present it. After I talked about the Scale, he
said it was the “most innovative contribution to neonatology that
he had experienced.” I was thrilled. Then he said, “But . . . using
a pin probe on the baby’s foot to demonstrate his ability to habituate to his pain was nothing short of sadistic!” Later, we dropped
this part of the demonstration because parents are too often upset
by it.

After publication of the NBAS, there were many detractors from
the field of child development:

## Page 230

282 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

e “It’s too complicated! No one but Brazelton could find ‘best performance’ in any reliable fashion.” This objection led to a study by the
Horowitz group of the University of Kansas which administered the NBAS using “average performance” as the basis of
assessment.° However, when looked at on the basis of average
performance, all babies began to seem alike, and the individuality of each baby, which was such an asset in demonstrating
the NBAS to new parents, seemed devalued. In establishing the
requirement that evaluators work toward “best performance,”
we have increased the demands of training to ensure reliability. Now, a new examiner must evaluate at least 20 babies
before reliability can be expected. We have learned a great
deal in seeking best performance—for example, that sensitivity to the baby’s use of states and his threshold for auditory,
visual, and tactile stimuli must be respected. With this kind
of sensitivity, which a trained examiner can develop, the
interrater reliability among examiners can be established
(above 90%) and maintained. There are now 18 international
training sites—four in the United States that have been
training evaluators successfully for 30 years.

e “Prediction of the neonate’s later performance based on his behavior
at birth is not as high as one might wish.” At first, | was stunned
at this objection. Why would one expect predictability from
newborn behavior? Only a severely brain-damaged infant
who might not change or a baby who would not need his
environment for change would predict to his future. Yet we
were able to increase predictability by increasing the number
of times at which we examined the neonate. By assessing him
three times—at birth, at two weeks, and at four weeks—we
could create a behavioral curve for the period from birth and
his recovery from delivery through to his adjustment to his
new environment; this curve gave us a more reliable curve for
prediction.°®

Behaviors that can be scored quantitatively, such as neonatal reflexes, can be reliable predictors of neurological impairments. But the 28 items that depend on state control and use of
state did not serve to be as predictive as we would have liked.
Hence, we added 8 items that are scored for their qualitative
predictability.” They can be added to evaluations of motor,
cognitive, and affective behavior of infants. These items give
parents a window into the kind of baby they can anticipate.
They have been found to be predictive of the quality of a child’s
performance at each subsequent age up to age 3.

The Role of the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale 283

e “Tt takes too long. No clinician would have the 18 to 20 minutes
required to evaluate all babies.” My own reaction is that every
neonate deserves a clinician’s attention for at least that
period if an evaluation is to be reliable. However, because of
this objection, and with our disappointment in the rather
sparse clinical use of the NBAS, Kevin Nugent and his group
created a shorter version, the Newborn Behavioral Observations (NBO) system. The NBO is not meant to be an assessment of the baby, but a way of sharing his unique behavioral
characteristics with his parents. I would hope that centers that
adopt the NBO will have a trained NBAS examiner available
to follow up on any deviation in behavior that is uncovered
by the NBO.’

We have learned so much from the use of the NBAS since its
publication in 1973. Over 800 articles in scientific publications all
over the world have demonstrated its usefulness for many valuable
research and clinical applications. In addition, there are at least four
specialized scales that have been derived from the NBAS:

1. Neonatal Behavioral Observations (NBO) system for use in

demonstrating newborn behaviors to parents.

2. Assessment of Preterm Infants’ Behavior (APIB) for use with
fragile and premature infants.’

3. Family Administered Neonatal Activities (FANA) that is directly
aimed at a communication with parents that share the baby."

4. NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) for use with
intrauterine drug-exposed babies."

Each of these has been published and has proven extremely

valuable for its intended use.

Over the years, we have utilized the NBAS to evaluate effects on
neonatal behavior in six areas of concern:

1. The effects of medication given to mothers prior to delivery,
recovery from the process of labor and delivery, and adjustment to the environment.

2. Intrauterine malnutrition and exposure to toxins such as
cigarette smoke, alcohol, and drugs.

3. Cross-cultural differences—significant differences found
among Asian, Caucasian, and African babies.

4. Effects of various delivery practices—cesarean, epidural, and
maternal premedication.

## Page 232

284 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

5. Special needs babies—sensory defects and their contribution
to sensory confusion in other areas, motor delays, autistic
spectrum disorders.

6. Designing interventions for special needs babies—identifying,
over the course of three assessments, three areas: (1) areas that
don’t change (and therefore cannot be improved by intervention); (2) areas that recover over the course of the three assessments and therefore don’t require intervention; and (3) areas
that change, but not satisfactorily—these areas, as identified
by the 28 assessment items, become the targets for a comprehensive early intervention program.

Over the years, the NBAS has become the most important
touchpoint for our team, which focuses on training practitioners
for intervention around the world. Now we apply these ideas to
the Touchpoints Approach.” Based on a relational model between
provider and parent, we recommend taking advantage of the
predictable times when parents are vulnerable (and, hence, available to the medical provider) to reach out to them. Each developmental Touchpoint represents an opportunity to offer both a positive
(as opposed to a deficit-focused) message about what parents
are doing well and a detailed observation of the infant’s behavior
in order to provide anticipatory guidance. In the first six years of
life, there are five to six times each year when the child regresses
prior to a burst in development; providers can use these Touchpoints
to share with parents two important concepts:

1. Regression is a time for reorganization.

2. Each developmental spurt is expensive and inevitably exacts

costs in other areas.

Emphasizing these fundamental realities with parents reduces
their vulnerability regarding their child’s current developmental
Touchpoint and also helps them understand their child’s overall
development and their role in fueling it. A medical provider who
shares these vulnerable Touchpoints deepens his or her relationship
with parents, which means that ultimately, parents and provider
are better able to collaborate effectively in the care of the child. The
parents, in turn, feel the success of the next burst in the child’s
development and begin to feel, “I know what I’m doing!” A parent’s feeling of success conveys itself to the child as “You are great!
You just did it yourself!”

her colleagues at the University of Miami. Field, one of the pioneers
in infancy research, in particular, in the role of touch, describes a
series of studies in different settings, in which she and her colleagues examined the effects of infant massage on newborn behavior. She reports the effects of a recent meta-analysis of data from 19
of these studies, which revealed that 72% of the massaged infants
were positively affected. Most of them experienced greater weight
gain and better performance on the NBAS. In addition, she points
out that the use of the NBAS seems to be an important demonstration to the parents of how their infants’ behavior can improve following massage therapy. This, in turn, seems to encourage parents
to continue massage therapy at home.

At the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Carme CostasMoragas has established an impressive research tradition by conducting numerous research studies on the effects of a wide range
of perinatal factors on developmental outcome. Chapter 4 provides
a review of this body of research, describing studies on the effects
of acute fetal distress, gestational and pregestational diabetes,
cesarean section, intrauterine exposure to lead, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, low birthweight, and prematurity.

At the invitation of Dr. Tomitaro Akiyama from the Department
of Rehabilitative Medicine at the University of Nagasaki, Berry
Brazelton and [began a collaborative longitudinal study of Japanese
infants in the Goto Islands in 1985. Dr. Akiyama’s research goal
was to identify the origins of cerebral palsy as early as possible ina
child’s life. In Chapter 5, along with his colleague, Shohei Ohgi, he
describes their research on the early assessment of infants at risk
for developmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy and mental
retardation. In a series of longitudinal studies, Shohei Ohgi and
the Nagasaki research group have provided consistent evidence
for the capacity of the NBAS to identify neonates who are at high
risk for later developmental disabilities, including cerebral palsy.

In Korea, Yeonghee Shin and Byunghi Park designed a study to
provide normative data on Korean newborn behavior. In Chapter 6
they describe the cultural context of the transition to parenthood in
Korean society and discuss their study of a sample of Korean newborns, explaining what their research reveals about the universals
of newborn behavior, and the behavioral characteristics that are
specific to the Korean cultural setting.

In her research and clinical practice in Geneva, pediatrician
and psychiatrist Nadia Bruschweiler-Stern discusses the significance of what she refers to as “moments of meeting” in promoting mother-infant attachment, beginning in the newborn period.

The Discovery of the Human Newborn: A Brief History 9
She defines these crucial interactions as micromoments of change
in the mother-infant relationship, moments when the relationship
is transformed and moves to a higher level. She goes on to describe
how she promotes these moments of meeting between parent and
infant and how the infant can become an “interlocutor” in this
process. In a series of clinical reflections taken from her practice,
Dr. Bruschweiler-Stern demonstrates how this approach can be
used with a wide range of families and how fathers can be engaged
in these relationship-building encounters.

Anthropologist Sara Harkness and psychologist Charles Super
introduced the concept of the infant’s “developmental niche” to
our understanding of the relationship between child and culture.
In Chapter 8, they discuss their work with Kipsigis herders and
farmers in Kenya and offer some observations on research with
parents and children in the United States, as well. They focus on
the process of discovery of parental ethnotheories and their instantiation in parenting practices. In the developmental niche framework, the culturally constructed environment of the child is
conceptualized as consisting of three components or subsystems:
(1) the physical and social settings in which the child lives;
(2) culturally regulated customs of child care and childbearing; and
(3) the psychology of the caretakers, including parents and others,
such as teachers or child-care providers.

INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON EARLY

INTERVENTION INITIATIVES
The NBAS has inspired intervention initiatives in many settings
around the world. In her work in Denmark, for example, psychologist Hanne Munck discusses how her research on fathers helped
establish the practice of fathers being encouraged to stay in the
hospital after delivery, so that they would have the opportunity to
become more involved in the care of the young infant. She also
describes how the NBAS and the APIB were used to demonstrate
the capacities and individuality of full-term newborns and prematurely born infants. She explains how the insights from these assessments played a significant role in modernizing hospital routines
and practice in Denmark as part of the preventive health-care
system.

In Britain, psychologist Joanna Hawthorne and occupational
therapist Betty Hutchon report that, with funding from the government’s early intervention project, Sure Start, several communitybased teams in deprived areas are being trained in providing

supportive intervention to mothers in deprived areas in their
follow-up home visits. In a brief survey of parents who participated
in follow-up professional education sessions, they report that all
the parents who responded to the survey said that they found the
principles of the NBAS helpful and would recommend it to other
parents. The U.K. experience demonstrates that the NBAS can provide a supportive intervention to parents of premature babies, parents of babies with various syndromes, and parents with babies
who may be difficult to read.

Physical therapist Yvette Blanchard describes how the NBO
system, which was inspired by the NBAS, is being used in early
intervention settings in the United States and how the NBO neuro
behavioral concepts can be integrated into Early Intervention (EI)
evaluation and service planning. While many states require a score
from a standardized tool in order to determine eligibility for EI, the
information gathered during the NBO can be used to provide clinical information needed by the early interventionist to substantiate
eligibility on the basis of clinical judgment. The integration of the
NBO into the evaluation of high-risk infants allows the EI providers to meet the three goals of a developmental assessment: (1) The
infant’s attempts to self-regulate and successes at self-regulation
are indicators of the current level of developmental maturity and
robustness; (2) the infant’s behavioral manifestations of disorganization or loss of self-regulation are indicators of developmental
vulnerabilities and sensory thresholds; (3) the type and amount of
support offered by the clinician forms the basis of the individualized intervention strategy and educational approach needed to
support the developmental agenda and goals of this infant and to
promote the relationship between the infant and his parents and
the relationship between the provider and the parents.

Psychologist Beulah Warren has spent her life working in early
intervention settings in Australia and has devoted a great deal of that
time to the training of early intervention and infant mental health
specialists who work with infants and families in the first years of
life. In Chapter 12 she describes her work with infants who are at risk
for developmental disabilities and explains how she uses an individualized, developmentally appropriate approach to support her
young patients, their parents, and even their extended families.

As a young pediatrician, Nittaya Kotchabhakdi spent the first
6 months of her pediatric rotation in the northeastern province of Thailand, where she gained firsthand experience working
with children and families affected by poverty, malnutrition,

and preventable diseases. To reduce malnutrition, she initiated
developmentally based breastfeeding programs for mothers and
infants in these rural communities. In Chapter 13 she describes the
NBAS-inspired education programs she implemented, which were
designed to sensitize mothers to their babies’ interactive competencies, with a view to supporting a positive mother-infant bond and
resultant success in breastfeeding.

Nurse Researcher Kristie Brandt points out that for more than 3
decades, the principle underlying the NBAS has informed the discipline of nursing—guiding both the development of clinical care
models and the refinement of specific intervention, facilitation, and
support strategies. She explains how, in the programs she has initiated for parents in the first 8 weeks after birth, the maternal-childfamily nurse is able to “showcase and observe the newborn’s
individuality as expressed in his or her mastery and clarity of cues,
and other behavioral repertoire.”

INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
In recent years, the individualized and positive-adaptive approach
to infants and families, derived from the NBAS, has been used to
inform curriculum development in medical education and professional development settings worldwide. The notion central to the
Touchpoints Approach to professional training which was developed by Berry Brazelton and his colleagues, is that a child’s development is characterized by predictable periods of disorganization
that occur prior to bursts in development. Because all development
occurs within caregiving relationships, the extent to which the system supports these relationships has a direct impact on the child’s
developmental potential. Brazelton Touchpoints faculty members
Ann Stadtler and John Hornstein describe the newborn Touchpoint
as “the prototypical touchpoint” because it is the time of greatest
vulnerability, as well as the time of greatest opportunity for professionals working with parents. They go on to explain how the
Touchpoints training model has been applied to different settings
and how its goal of supporting providers and communities in
changing the system of care for families has been implemented.

The name of Jodo Carlos Gomes-Pedro is synonymous with
medical education in Portugal. In Chapter 16 Dr. Gomes-Pedro
reviews the dramatic changes taking place in contemporary Portuguese society and describes how he developed an individualized

## Page 263

12 Looxinc BAcK

behaviorally based approach to support new parents and to help
health-care providers offer the kind of informational and emotional
support parents need today. He also describes his approach to
medical education and resident training and his efforts to implement a more positive model of patient care.

Psychotherapist Drina Candilis-Huisman and _ pediatrician
Marie Fabre-Grenet write about their approach to parents in their
respective practices in France. Dr. Huisman describes her work
with mothers in the maternity ward. She looks at this relationship
as a threesome, in which the clinician retains a flexible and distinctly different role with both the mother and the infant. She
shows that the success of this approach depends not only on the
clinician’s ability to accurately assess the infant’s capacities but
also on the dynamic relationship that emerges among the different partners. The clinician’s effectiveness depends on his or her
flexibility, “an essential quality about which we need to conduct
more research.” Dr. Grenet explains her use of the NBAS in her
pediatric practice as a response to the tendency of the medical
system to “hypermedicalize pregnancy.” The observation of the
behavior of the neonate that is formalized in the NBAS enables
the practitioner to focus on the baby as an individual. Dr. Grenet
believes that the NBAS can be used during this time and that
early first contact in the hospital sets the foundation of a real therapeutic alliance.

In North Carolina in the United States, James Helm and Marie
Reilly have been training early intervention professionals for many
years. Their training programs includes NIDCAP-based, developmentally supportive, family-centered care of infants and families in
the intensive care nursery (ICN), a developmental follow-up clinic,
and an early intervention program that begins in the hospital and
follows the family home. In Chapter 18 they describe how the
NBAS contributes to each of these services and how the NBAS is
also used to help identify program goals and activities with families as an integral part of the follow-up program

“What is relationship-based care?” is the question posed by Constance Keefer, Lise Johnson, and Susan Minear in their discussion
of the role of the pediatrician in hospital newborn care. They point
out that practitioners are charged with nurturing two distinct relationships in the newborn period—that of the parent and child, and
that of the clinician and family. Both are necessary components of
effective medical care. Over the years, at least two important clinical tools gradually evolved from the NBAS to promote these
relationships—the PEBE and the NBO systems, each of which took

## Page 264

The Discovery of the Human Newborn: A Brief History 13
the relational aspects of the NBAS a step further. The use of these
approaches is discussed, and the roles of each in fostering the bonds
between parent and infant and between clinician and family are
also presented. With the PEBE, the practitioner weaves observations
and a narrative of the infant’s behavior into the standard newborn
physical exam, which he or she performs in the presence of the
parents. Meanwhile, the NBO was designed primarily as a
relationship-building tool that can help sensitize parents to their
newborn’s capacities and individuality. The authors go on to discuss the use of the NBO as a concrete tool for the professional clinician in training.

Since the NBAS is an examination that demands an extraordinarily high level of observational and handling skill, it can be used
as a model for training professionals in working with infants and
their families. This challenge is specifically addressed by NBAS
master trainer Jean Cole and NBAS trainers Cecilia Matson and
Thembi Ranuga in Chapter 20, “Preparing Professionals to Work
with Newborns.” They present their firsthand experiences as trainers and their recommendations for the training of examiners. They
emphasize the importance of examiners being well versed in neuro
developmental principles before they even approach the actual
assessment of the infant. Then they focus on the need for examiners to have good observational and handling skills to be able to
elicit the infant’s “best performance.” Finally, they describe the different training models used to prepare professionals to use the
NBAS reliably and sensitively.

At Anna Meyer Children’s Hospital in Florence, Italy, Gherardo
Rapisardi, aneonatologist and pediatrician, and Adrienne Davidson,
a pediatric physical therapist and developmental specialist, have
been training a wide range of health-care specialists since the
beginning of the 1980s. The training programs focus on the clinical
application of a global neurodevelopmental assessment and an
early intervention program that incorporate the principles of the
Touchpoints model. In addition, there are training courses in
the NBAS concepts for all types of health professionals throughout
Italy who are involved in neonatal care. In Naples, Drs. Roberto
Paludetto and Giuseppina Mansi have conducted research on the
effects of neonatal jaundice, the effects of prematurity, and
the effects of cigarette smoking on newborn behavior. They have
incorporated the general concepts of the NBAS into the physical
examination of the newborn, paying special attention to the
orientation, Response Decrement, Self-Quieting, Consolability, and
Cuddliness items.

LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

In the final section of the book, we look toward the future and address
the question of how this new body of information can help researchers, clinicians, and policymakers better understand the needs of
infants and families as the twenty-first century moves ahead. As we
review the past and attempt to plan for the future, Rachel Keen, a pioneer in the infancy field and still one of its leading researchers,
reminds us that that there is a great need for researchers to bring their
work closer to practitioners and policymakers. She believes that the
gap can be bridged, but it will take sustained, deliberate efforts on
both sides. Researchers need to make their results and implications
more easily available beyond their own circles, and they need to talk
to social workers, pediatricians, nurses, and other personnel who
intervene in children’s lives. Above all, collaborative research should
be the core of continued communication. This volume is designed to
promote these kinds of collaborative endeavors. To use her own
words, “only when the lines of communication are freely open and
flowing will we have the knowledge exchange we so badly need.”

John Kennell who with Marshall Klaus introduced the concept
of parent-infant bonding,” challenges us to consider the value of
simple interventions in the perinatal period, even as he acknowledges that health-care professionals and clinicians are being asked
to care for an ever-larger number of children with developmental /
behavioral problems of increasing complexity. He describes doula
support as a low-tech, centuries-old intervention that significantly
reduces the need for cesarean delivery, analgesia, and other interventions; shortens the length of labor; enhances mother-infant interaction; and helps promote successful breastfeeding. He presents
evidence from his own work that the promotion of parent-infant
bonding by providing doula support results in fewer child behavior problems. Almost 40 years of research have shown that when
mothers have continuous emotional support by a doula during
labor, and when they have early and extended contact and interaction with their babies, significant benefits can result.

After a description of his involvement in the NBAS in the early
years, Ed Tronick looks toward the future and urges a word of caution in Chapter 24, “The Brazelton Baby: The Other Side of the
Coin.” He points out that while the NBAS has made us aware of
the infant’s competencies, we also need to recognize the anomalies and medical conditions that may disrupt development.
The competent infant can also be the incompetent infant, the pathologic infant, he tells us. He challenges researchers to think about

## Page 266

The Discovery of the Human Newborn: A Brief History 15
functional pathologies and to begin to examine the pathologic
effects of functional compromises because “doing so may help us
understand an often times disregarded fact: Most infants and
young children with mental health, neurobehavioral, and neuropsychological problems were clinically normal newborns.”

Bonnie Petrauskas addresses the challenges facing families in
today’s society. She discusses the effects of poverty and the consequences of inadequate health care in many societies across the
world. She then describes the challenges faced by parents today,
their sense of isolation, and their need for support. She examines
the changing role of fathers and the need for inclusive intervention
strategies that are family centered and community based. She concludes by saying, “Healthcare professionals, educated in a strengthbased approach to neonatal assessment, can take the leadership
role in providing parents with accurate, consistent, and personalized information about their children.”

Daniel Stern, whose work straddles the fields of psychoanalysis,
psychotherapy, philosophy, developmental psychology, neuroscience, and infant mental health, and Nadia Bruschweiler-Stern,
who has also contributed elsewhere in this volume, maintain that
advances in neuroscience will be enriched by the kind of behavioral observation techniques pioneered by the NBAS. As they look
toward the future, they argue that Brazelton’s concept of “optimal
performance” provides a unique observational approach that
makes it possible to study the full complexity and unpredictability of “the present moment” in parent-child interactions, what
they refer to as “the temporal dimension of experience” and the
“complex melodic line of experience.” They suggest that combining the observational techniques of the NBAS and emerging
imaging techniques will allow for more comprehensive exploration
of brain functioning, which will tell us more about the developing
nature of intersubjectivity. Finally, they acknowledge the seminal
role of Berry Brazelton’s contribution to our current understanding
of infancy, ending their chapter by saying that his work “will guide
and provide ideas for our field in its future dialogues with the
neurosciences.”

In Chapter 27, Berry Brazelton himself tells his own story—the
story of how he came to discover the human newborn, not only as
competent and unique but also as a social organism, ready to interact with the caregiver from the very beginning. He shares his original vision for the NBAS and how it came to be realized, and he
introduces the people who influenced him and those who helped
him realize his dream. As Dr. Brazelton looks toward the future, his

## Page 267

16 LOoKING BACK
concern is focused on how to better prepare pediatric professionals
and educators to support parents and their children, beginning in
the newborn period. He presents his Touchpoints model as a framework for realizing this vision, as a way of helping the practitioner
“deepen his or her relationship with parents, which means that
parents and provider are better able to collaborate effectively in the
care of the child.”

CONCLUSION
In this chapter, I have taken a look back at the field of infancy
research and practice and the pivotal role played by the NBAS in
its evolution and, indeed, its transformation. I have described how
our understanding of the newborn infant has been enriched by
Brazelton’s work and that of his colleagues and how our appreciation of the significance of early experiences has been deepened and
expanded.

The research and clinical work described in this volume, coming
as it does from a wide range of disciplines and gathered in very
different cultural settings, demonstrates how much this body of work
has influenced clinical work with families across the world. These
original reports—written by pediatricians, nurses, psychologists,
psychiatrists, physical therapists, early education and infancy specialists, occupational therapists, and psychotherapists—also attest to
the shift in emphasis toward intervention that is both family-centered
and relationship-based and that begins in the newborn period and
before. It is our hope that this new approach will inspire an even
deeper understanding of the infant as an individual and as a person
and will lead to a greater appreciation and respect for the role parents play in supporting their infants’ adaptation and development.

Finally, we hope that these reports can serve as a challenge to
researchers and policymakers alike to work together toward forging comprehensive family-centered social policies that support
children and families everywhere.

CHAPTER 2
Predicting Development for
Extremely Low Birthweight

Infants: Sweden
KARIN STJERNOQVIST
The overall aim of this longitudinal study was to follow the
development of a sample of tiny, extremely low birthweight
(ELBW) infants born in the mid-1980s. These infants had seldom
survived before. We wanted to get a comprehensive view of outcomes for the children and study the impact of their prematurity
and related complications on the lives of their families.17°4° This
chapter focuses on the use of the NBAS to predict neurobehavioral
and cognitive outcomes at 4 and 10 years.
POPULATION

In a region of southern Sweden, 32,120 infants were live-born
during the period from November 1984 to October 1986. Of these,
65 (0.2%) had birthweights less than 901 g. When possible, pregnant
women at risk for preterm delivery (delivery before 28 completed
weeks) were transferred ante partum to the regional center. However, transfer to the regional center was not always possible. Fortytwo of the 65 ELBW infants were treated in the neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU) at the University Hospital, Lund, Sweden, a
regional tertiary (Level III) perinatal center with 10 referral hospitals. Twenty-three (55%) of the 42 ELBW infants at Lund survived
the neonatal period, and with parental consent, 20 of the 23 survivors were enrolled in an extended follow-up program.

22 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

The infants in the study group, 12 girls and 8 boys, had a mean
birthweight of 775 g (SD + 109) and were born at 26.2 (m) weeks
gestational age (SD + 1.8). Three infants were small for their gestational age (SGA < —2 SD). Assessment of the gestational age was
based on an ultrasonography examination in early pregnancy. The
infants were recruited prior to the time when drug surfactant was
routinely used to accelerate maturation of the lungs of premature
infants. Fourteen infants (70%) had been treated with artificial ventilation. Eight of the 20 (40%), had intracranial hemorrhage (ICH),
diagnosed and graded by cranial ultrasound according to Papile
et al.’ Two infants had gerade IV bleeding; two had grade III; two
had grade IJ; and two had grade I. Periventricular leucomalacia
(PVL) was found by ultrasound examination in two infants—one
with grade IV, and one with grade III ICH, as well. The average
hospitalization time was 124 days (SD + 66) (range 70-334), of
which an average of 51 days (SD + 20) (range 10-95), were spent in
the neonatal intensive care unit before the infants were moved to
wards for intermediate care or to local hospitals.

FULL-TERM CONTROL GROUPS
Two different control groups of full-term infants were studied—
one for a study conducted at term, and one for the long-term
study—because the long-term follow-up study required an extensive and time-consuming matching procedure, which could not be
carried out until the infants had been registered at the national
child healthcare clinics.

For the neurobehavioral assessment at term, a control group of
20 healthy, full-term infants—10 girls and 10 boys who all were
born during 1986—were consecutively selected in the maternity
clinic. The criteria were that they were born by vaginal delivery
and without any neonatal complications, after a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy. All mothers who were asked consented to have
their infants assessed. The average birthweight of these infants was
3,655 g (SD + 370), and they were born at 40 weeks gestational age
(SD + 0.81)

At the 1-, 4-, and 10-year assessments, a pair-matched control
group was chosen at the child health-care clinics. The criteria were
that the children, as infants, had been born by vaginal delivery after
a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy, without any neonatal complications, and without separations between mother and infant in the
neonatal period. The children were matched for gender and birth

order, as well as for their parents’ socioeconomic status, educational
level, and citizenship (native Swede or immigrant). Because the
study group was small, comprising only 20 infants and families, it
was essential to find close pair-matches in the control group in
order to increase comparability. The children in the control group
were born during a 2-year period, all between 1985 and 1986. Their
birthweights were (mean + SD) 3,660 g + 586, and they were born
in gestational week (mean + SD) 40.1 + 1.3. There were 12 girls and
8 boys. The socioeconomic and educational standards were normal
for a Swedish population. While the proportion of immigrant mothers (25%) was higher than we had expected, it was still the same in
both the ELBW and the control families.

PROCEDURE AND METHODS

For all those involved in the study group, the father was usually
present during the delivery. Whenever possible, the mother was
given the opportunity to look at and touch her baby before it
was taken to the NICU. To stress that the newborn was part of the
family, the father was invited to accompany his infant to the NICU.
He was also present during the first caretaking procedures, and he
was thereby an important intermediary between the infant and the
mother. A photograph of the infant was taken and given to
the mother. Care of the ELBW infants was individualized. We had
been inspired by the work of Dr. Heidelise Als, even if, at that time,
full Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment
Program (NIDCAP) observations were not performed.®? Every
effort was made to minimize the amount of stimulation to which
the infants were subjected, so that, for example, the light intensity
was softened and the noise level kept low.

As soon as possible, often within the first hour, the mother came
to the NICU to be with her newborn. The neonatal unit personnel
worked actively to facilitate attachment between the parents and
siblings and the newborn infant. Parents and siblings could visit
the baby anytime and were encouraged to take part in the care of
their baby from the first day. For siblings, there was a playroom in
which there was a miniature incubator with a doll and other toys.
Parents got support from the nurses, doctors, and psychologist to
cope with the traumatic experiences of the preterm birth and their
anxiety about their infant’s survival and future impairments.
Nurses helped the parents to become aware of and to interpret the
weak signals of their infant and to find ways to enjoy him or her.

## Page 276

24 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

Kangaroo care, where the infant is swaddled close to the mother or
father’s breast, skin-to-skin, was used frequently, even when the
infants were very small.

Sweden had, in the mid-1980s, 12 months’ paid parental leave,
which could be shared between the mother and the father.
When parents had a sick infant, they got an additional 60 days of
paid parental leave per year, which could also be shared between
the parents. This national insurance system made it possible for
both parents to be with their newborn infant, and most of them
were there, from morning until late evening every day. Also, other
relatives were welcome to visit the newborn. All information about
the infant’s current condition, as well as all plans for interventions,
were shared with the parents.

During the 10-year follow-up period of the study, the children
(both ELBW and control groups) were assessed four times; the
ELBW parents were interviewed three times; and the control group
parents were interviewed twice.

MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND BEHAVIOR

At the term assessment, the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale
(NBAS)'° was used. Consisting of 27 behavioral items and originally constructed for assessment of full-term newborn infants (to
be used during the first 8 weeks of life), it has frequently been used
to assess preterm infants as early as in the 32nd gestational week.'"”
The scale gives an estimation of the infant’s habituation to stimuli,
response to auditory and visual stimuli, ability to interact, range of
states, and capacity to regulate states. The NBAS assessment of the
infants and the scoring were done according to the manual.!? But
the ELBW infants were assessed one hour before a feeding, as recommended by Sell et al,’ instead of halfway between feedings, as
recommended for full-term infants. The 27 items were reduced into
six clusters of behaviors according to the Lester data reduction
scheme: I: Habituation, II: Orientation, II: Motor, IV: Range of State,
V: Regulation of State, and VI: Autonomic Stability.’° The raw
scores were recoded so that higher scores indicated optimal
responses for individual items and for clusters.

At the 4-year assessments, Griffiths’ Mental Developmental
Scale II was used.'*> This method was chosen because it has been
translated into Swedish and standardized for Swedish conditions.
Griffiths’ Scale covers different areas of development: the locomotor scale (A), the personal-social scale (B), the hearing-and-speech
scale (C), the eye-and-hand coordination scale (D), the performance

## Page 277

Predicting Development for Extremely Low Birthweight Infants 25
scale (E), and a logic scale (F). The subscales are combined to give a
total score. From the scores on each subscale, a mental age (MA) is
calculated. The Developmental Quotient (DQ) bases on the normal
curve are calculated by dividing the MA by the child’s age and
multiplying by 100. The mean (M) is 100, and the SD is 15. Assessments of the children and the scoring were both done according to
the manual.

To assess cognitive ability at the 10-year follow-up, the Weschler
Intelligence Scale for Children, WISC-III, was used.!° Ten subtests
were administered, and full-scale, verbal, and performance IQ
scores were calculated.

STATISTICS
Differences between the two groups on continuous variables were
tested with the student’s f test; and if the requirements for that test
were not fulfilled, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used. For crosstables, the chi-square test was used; and when the number of individuals required for that test was not enough, the Fisher exact test
was used. Correlations were studied with Pearson’s correlation
coefficients (7).

RESULTS

NEUROBEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT AT TERM
Eighteen of 20 ELBW infants who were enrolled in the long-term
psychological follow-up program were evaluated with the NBAS at
the time of expected birth. The mean gestational age at the time of
the examination was 41.3 weeks, and the mean postnatal age was
106 days. Two infants had to be excluded because one was severely
ill at the time, and the other had left the area. The ELBW infants
were compared with 20 full-term, healthy infants examined at the
mean postnatal age of 3.3 days (mean gestational age, 40.6 weeks).

Significant group differences were found for 8 of the 27 NBAS
items (Table 2.1). The higher the scores, the better the performance.
In seven items the ELBW infants scored significantly lower than
the control group, and on one item, they scored significantly higher.
The greatest differences between the groups were in the Motor
performance and Regulation of State clusters. Within the latter
cluster, there were significant differences in two items: The ELBW
infants had more difficulty calming down when upset (Item 26)
and comforting themselves by sucking on their hands (Item 27).

In the Orientation cluster, the ELBW infants had better scores in
three of four items on auditory measurements, one of which reached
statistical significance—listening to and localizing a voice. On one
item in the Habituation cluster—response to pinprick of the foot—
the ELBW infants were considerably more sensitive to stimuli.

In accordance with the NBAS manual, each child’s best performance was scored, with the examiner returning to the same items
several times during the assessment in order to get the optimum
response from the infant. The ELBW infants demanded more sensitivity from the examiner, more repeated administrations of individual items in order to achieve appropriate responses, and more
pauses during testing. The stress factor expected during this examination was exhibited by the ELBW infants through signs of physiological instability, including jitteriness and short apneic spells.
Usually, they recovered quickly after a short rest. The full-term
infants made attempts to control the overload by, for example, gaze
aversion and yawns. Parents were present at all NBAS assessments,
and the examiner discussed observations of the baby’s strong and
weak areas with them.

FOLLOW-UP AT FOUR YEARS
At the 4-year follow-up, the ELBW infants had significantly lower
values on all subscales of the Griffiths’ test than the full-term

control children. The developmental quotients (mean and SD) were
96.1 (8.5) and 113 (9.3), respectively (p < .001).

Correlations between the results of the NBAS at calculated term
(when the ELBW infants were 10-16 weeks old) and developmental quotients measured with the Griffiths’ test at 4 years of age are
shown in Table 2.2. The Orientation items correlated positively
with both the Griffiths’ total score, DQ (r = .42, p < .05), and the
eye-and-hand coordination scale, E (r = .47, p < .05; not shown).
These results indicate that it might be possible to predict development at 4 years of age from results of Orientation items of the NBAS
in the neonatal period. However, further research is necessary to
verify these findings.

FOLLOW-UP AT 10 YEARS
All ELBW children and the full-term controls were reassessed at 10
years of age. The results on WISC full-scale IQ for the groups were
(mean and SD) 87.7 (12.1) and 106 (14.9), respectively (p < .001).

At the 10-year follow-up, we found an even stronger correlation
between the results on the WISC full-scale IQ, and the NBAS orientation item (r = 0.62, p < = .01). This cluster was correlated with the
Verbal IQ (r = 0.51, p = .05) and the Performance IQ (r = 0.62, p = .01)
Regression analyses show that Orientation items explained 34% of
the variance in IQ at 10 years. There were no statistically significant
correlations between the other NBAS clusters and IQ at this age.

Predicting Development for Extremely Low Birthweight Infants 29
CONCLUSION

The neurobehavioral differences between the ELBW infants at
term and the control full-term infants in our study were not as
large as reported in previous studies.'"!* Several circumstances
might explain this unexpected finding. First, the control group
was studied on the third day of life because the postnatal care
period in the maternity ward after normal delivery in Sweden
was 2 to 4 days, even though a previous study of neurobehavioral
assessment of full-term Swedish infants found that the postnatal
adaptation for full-term infants was not completed until after
5 days of age.!” Second, Solkoff and Matuszak have shown that
with additional tactile stimulation, very low birthweight (VLBW)
infants—those with weights below 1500 g—had better scores on
the NBAS test for tonus, habituation to sound and light, changes
of sleep-awake state, and alertness, in comparison with preterm
infants without such stimulation.'® Third, several studies have
shown that ELBW infants receiving individualized neonatal care
require less ventilator treatment and have better mental development than ELBW infants not treated in this way.?1?07122 Th our
NICU in Lund, individualized care was given; this included low
lighting and reduced sound, combined with the stimulation of
parent-infant skin-to-skin contact with frequent kangaroo care.
We cannot prove, although we do speculate, that such procedures
may have influenced the unexpectedly high scores on some NBAS
items among our ELBW infants when compared with full-term
babies.

It is important to note, though, that although our ELBW infants
showed a wide behavioral range at term, parents had to put a lot of
effort into eliciting responses from them. At the same time, they
had to be observant for physiological signs of fatigue from overstimulation. If the ELBW infants became distressed during testing,
they needed more comforting compared with the full-term control
infants. All this indicates that parents will need detailed advice on
how to give optimal support to their ELBW babies. They should be
made aware of their babies’ fluctuating states of behavior and individual social needs, and, furthermore, they need to be told that the
developmental process of the ELBW baby implies not only change
but also instability.8 An important observation from our data—both
for future neonatal care and parent counseling—is that for the very
tiny preterm infant, even at term age, the periods of alertness every
day when he or she is fully able to participate in social interaction,
are short, but regular.

30 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

An interesting finding of our study was the positive correlation
between the Orientation items in the NBAS at term, DQ at 4 years
of age, and IQ at 10 years, even though, in the neonatal period,
instability in physical, physiological, and behavioral systems is
pronounced, and neonatal assessments are thought to be less predictive.'° A tentative explanation for our finding might be that the
early strategy for coping with environmental stimuli is essential for
later perception and thereby influences development.

Concerning the cognitive development for ELBW children at
preschool and early school-age, our findings are in agreement with
other follow-up studies of ELBW children.**° ELBW children
had approximately one SD lower IQ than full-term mates.*77

It is obvious that interventions at different levels are needed
to support ELBW children’s development. Besides continuous
improvements in medical care, more directed individualized developmental care in the neonatal period is needed. Long-term intervention programs aiming to give parents a better understanding of
the characteristics of their ELBW children’s development are also
warranted. With our very positive experiences from doing one
NBAS examination and sharing our findings with the parents, we
started an intervention program to support children’s development
and to enhance parent-infant interaction. We recruited VLBW
infants born before the 33rd gestational week who did not have
major intra-cranial hemorrhages or malformations from two different hospitals in the south of Sweden. Fifty-nine infants fulfilled our
criteria, and the parents of 54 infants gave their informed consent
to participation. The infants were randomized into an intervention
group and a control group. The interventions started in the 34th
gestational week with four hospital-based interventions and was
followed by eleven home-based interventions during the first six
months after discharge—all performed by two trained nurses.

Parts of the NBAS were used at the different intervention sessions, and the nurses’ experience of each infant’s performance and
maturation over time was shared with the parents.

The mothers in both the intervention group and the nonintervention group had depressive symptoms three times more often
than mothers of full-term infants (38% versus 12%) during the two
weeks after the birth but before the onset of the intervention, as
measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.7® For
the mothers in the intervention group, the depressive symptoms
were significantly lower when the infants were 3, 6, and 12 months
old (age corrected for degree of prematurity)—7%, 4%, and 7%,
respectively—while those of the mothers in the control group

## Page 284

Predicting Development for Extremely Low Birthweight Infants 31
remained at a higher level—22%, 19%, and 23%—for the corresponding periods. In addition, the mothers in the intervention
group reported less social isolation and relationship problems with
their partners than the mothers in the control group. At 12 months
corrected age, there was a difference between the intervention and
control groups on the mental developmental index on the Bayley
Scale—92 and 87, respectively—but it did not reach statistical significance. At this age, also, the quality of the mother-child relationship was significantly better in the intervention group, as measured
with the Early Relational Assessment Scale.”

With these results in hand, we gradually incorporated NBAS
into our NICU discharge program and follow-up clinic, and we
continue to use parts of it for intervention at different sessions.

We are now reassessing the former ELBW children when they
are young adults, and will soon be able to determine whether NBAS
results at term is a reliable predictor of outcomes in adult life.

The Effects of Newborn
Massage: United States
TIFFANY FIELD
FULL-TERM NEWBORNS

Infant massage is practiced in most of the Eastern world. In
many countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Bali, Fiji, New Guinea,
New Zealand (the Maori), and the Soviet Union, infants are given a
massage with oil after the daily bath and before sleep time for the
first several months of their lives. Infant massage is only recently
being discovered in the Western world. Massage therapy schools in
almost every U.S. city teach parents how to massage their infants.
The techniques they teach are based on Indian massage, which is
described in publications by two massage therapists who trained
in India.'”

The Indian infant massage is a daily bath time routine that
begins in the first days of life. The infant is laid on his stomach on
the mother’s outstretched legs as she sits on the ground, and each
body part is individually massaged. Warm water and soap are
applied to the legs, arms, back, abdomen, neck, and face. The massage looks like scrubbing clothes on an old washboard and seems
extremely rigorous (almost rough). After they are massaged and

swaddled, the infants sleep for prolonged periods (perhaps to
recover from the stress of the massage). Although data have not yet
been collected on this technique, some infant massage therapists
have attributed the precocious motor development of these infants
to their daily massages. They suggest that the massage provides
both stimulation and relaxation, improving respiration, circulation,
digestion, and elimination.? They claim that infants who are
massaged sleep more soundly and that the massage relieves gas
and colic and helps the healing process during illness by easing
congestion and pain.

We have recently confirmed that the moderate pressure used in
the Indian massage is crucial to growth effects and improved performance on the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS).*
In our study, we assessed the effects of moderate and light pressure massage on the growth and development of young infants.
Mothers were instructed to massage their newborn infants once
per day using either light or moderate pressure. The infants’ growth
(weight, length, head circumference), sleep behavior, and performance on the NBAS were assessed soon after birth and at one month
of age. Our results showed that infants in the moderate pressure
group gained more weight and length than infants who received a
light pressure massage, performed better on the Orientation cluster
of the NBAS, had lower NBAS excitability and depression scores,
and exhibited less agitated behavior during sleep.

PRETERM NEWBORNS

Most of the research on the effects of infant massage has been
conducted with preterm (premature) infants. During the past two
decades most of the studies conducted were labeled tactile/
kinesthetic stimulation because of the negative connotations of the
word massage. Generally, the results have been positive. A recent
meta-analysis of data from 19 of these studies revealed that 72% of
the massaged infants were positively affected.° Most of them experienced greater weight gain and better performance on the NBAS.®
Those studies that did not report significant weight gain had used
the wrong kind of touch—a light stroking procedure. Infants do
not respond positively to light touch, probably because it feels like
tickling. The babies who gained weight had been given moderate
pressure massage, which stimulated both tactile and pressure
receptors.

One of the studies included in the meta-analysis was conducted
in our lab.’ In that study, we gave premature newborns massage

therapy for 45 minutes a day (in doses of three 15-minute periods)
for 10 days. The infants, on average, were 9 weeks premature,
weighed about 2 pounds, and had been treated in intensive care for
approximately 3 weeks before the study. The massages were started
as the infants graduated from the “grower nursery” at a time when
their primary reason for being in the nursery was to gain weight.
The massage therapy sessions were divided into three phases. For
the first and third phases of the massage, the newborns were placed
on their stomachs and gently stroked for five, 1-minute periods (six
back-and-forth strokes at approximately 10 seconds each for each
of the 1-minute periods) over each region in the following sequence:
(1) from the top of the head to the neck and back to the top of the
head, (2) from the nape of the neck across to the end of the shoulders and back to the neck, (3) from the upper back to the waist and
back to the upper back, (4) from the top of the thigh to the foot and
back to the thigh on both legs, and (5) from the shoulder to the
hand and back to the shoulder on both arms. As already noted,
moderate pressure was applied. During the second 5-minute phase,
the infants’ arms and legs were moved back and forth much like
bicycling motions (into flexion and extension) while the infants
were lying on their backs. First the right arm, then the left arm,
then the right leg, then the left, and finally both legs were moved
again in slow motion for 1 minute each for a total of 5 minutes.

By the end of the 10-day treatment period, the massaged preterm infants in this study had gained 47% more weight than
the control group, even though both groups consumed the same
amount of formula. The massaged infants were surprisingly awake
and active more of the time, even though we expected they would
sleep more. In addition, they performed better than the control
group on the Habituation, Orientation, Motor, and Range of State
clusters on the NBAS. Further, they were discharged from the
hospital 6 days sooner, saving approximately $3,000 per infant
in hospital costs. Today, the comparable cost savings would be
$10,000, which means that if the 470,000 premature infants born
each year in the United States were massaged, $4.7 billion in hospital costs would be saved annually. In a similar study conducted
over a 5-day, instead of a 10-day, period, we also noted a 47%
greater increase in weight gain in the massaged preterm infants,
suggesting that 5-day treatment periods would be even more cost
effective.®

In other parts of the world, researchers have used the same massage procedure and have reported similar effects. In the Philippines,
Dr. Cifra and her colleagues reported nearly the same weight gain

(45%);? and in Taiwan, another group of neonatologists reported
increased weight gain—as well as increased growth (length and
head circumference)—in their massaged preterm infants. In Israel,
the same massage was used, but the infants’ mothers performed the
massages instead of the massage therapists.'° The Israeli researchers
also reported infant weight gain; in addition, the mothers benefited
by decreased postpartum depression. Finally, a decrease in stress
hormones has been reported for massaged newborns: In a study
conducted in London,'!! blood samples were obtained for cortisol
(stress hormone) levels. Cortisol levels significantly decreased after
massage, and there was also a slight decrease in skin temperature.
MASSAGE THERAPY WITH OTHER
HIGH-RISK NEWBORNS

Cocaine-exposed preterm infants also benefit from massage
therapy.” After receiving the massage described previously (three
times daily for a 10-day period), the massaged cocaine-exposed
preterm infants experienced fewer medical complications and
showed less irritability than cocaine-exposed infants not massaged.
They also gained 28% more weight, on average, than the control
group, and they performed better on the NBAS, especially on the
Orientation and Motor clusters. Finally, they showed fewer stress
behaviors on a Neonatal Stress Scale.'’ The Neonatal Stress Scale
was developed to characterize the stress behaviors that cocaineexposed neonates show during NBAS assessments. The scale comprises 11 items that are operationally defined in terms of the specific
behaviors/signs that occur either during particular NBAS items or
during the NBAS in general. They include tremors, restlessness, irritability, excessive high-pitched crying, hypertonia, abnormal reflex
behavior, abnormal Moro reflex, excessive mouthing, tachypnea,
autonomic instability, and gastrointestinal signs (such as vomiting
and diarrhea), and these behaviors are scored positive if present.

HIV exposure is another risk factor for less optimal performance
on the NBAS. Increasing numbers of newborns have been exposed
to HIV perinatally. In a study on HIV-exposed newborns, we
taught mothers how to massage their infants, and we experienced
almost 100% cooperation.'* This unusually high compliance rate
might have occurred because the mothers felt guilty for exposing
their infants to HIV. After two weeks of massage therapy, these
HIV-exposed infants experienced greater weight gain, and they
showed better performance on the Habituation, Motor, Range of
State, and Autonomic Stability scales of the NBAS.

38 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
PARENTS AND VOLUNTEERS AS
MASSAGE THERAPISTS

In order to provide massages to all newborns on a daily basis, and
at no cost, we have been teaching mothers, fathers, and volunteers
to massage the infants. To our surprise, the massagers also benefit.
In one study, for example, we taught depressed mothers to massage
their infants.!° We expected the mothers’ depression to decrease
and their infants’ distress behavior and disturbed sleep patterns to
decrease. The mothers gave their infants 15-minute massages daily
for a 2-week period. At the end of that time, the infants fell asleep
faster and slept longer, and they showed less fussiness. The mothers also benefited by this face-to-face interaction, showing better
behaviors with their infants.

In another study, we taught fathers to massage their infants. We
had demonstrated father massage for an Australian television
network because the producer “wanted to get Australian fathers
more involved in caregiving.” Following the television airing, an
Australian research group studied the effects of Australian fathers
massaging their infants. In this study, at a 3-month home observation, the fathers who massaged their infants showed greater
involvement with their infants than fathers who did not massage
their infants. The massaged infants also showed more eye contact,
smiling, and vocalizing with their fathers. We subsequently conducted a similar study, and again, the fathers who massaged their
infants for a month had better interactions with their babies than
fathers who did not.!°

We also taught infant massage to grandparent-age volunteers.!”
The “grandparent” volunteers then massaged neglected and abused
infants in a shelter. After giving the massages for one month, these
volunteers reported less anxiety and fewer depression symptoms.
Their cortisol (stress hormone) levels also decreased, and their lifestyles improved, including more social contacts and fewer visits to
their physicians. Thus, massage therapy not only helped the infants,
but also helped the adults who massaged the infants.

FOLLOW-UP STUDIES
The only follow-up study we have conducted assessed preterm
infants 8 to 12 months after they had been massaged as newborns.’®
Although clinicians are most impressed by the weight gain effects
of massage, parents may be more impressed by the behavioral
effects as measured by the NBAS. This possibility was highlighted
by the follow-up data showing that preterm infants who had been

## Page 293

The Effects of Newborn Massage: United States 39
massaged as newborns were performing better on the Bayley Scales
later in the first year. The massage therapy helped the newborns be
more responsive, behaviorally, as evidenced by their better NBAS
performance. In turn, the newborns were better able to interact
with their parents, who then were better interaction partners.
Because of this snowball effect, the infants showed better performance on developmental assessments (at one year). Thus, the weight
gain following massage therapy may help the infants go home
sooner, while the improved behavior as manifested on the NBAS
may help the infants elicit better stimulation from their parents
and, in turn, achieve superior development. These pathways, of
course, need further research. At this point, our experience shows
us that the use of the NBAS seems to be an important demonstration to the parents of how their infants’ behavior can improve
following massage therapy. This, in turn, seems to encourage
parents to continue massage therapy at home.

CHAPTER 4
Perinatal Factors Influencing
Development: Spain
CARME COSTAS-MORAGAS

Catalonia, with Barcelona as its capital city, is located on the east
coast of the Iberian Peninsula. It covers an area of 31.895 km, and,
as of 2007 had a population of 7,210,508. In 2006, the birth rate in
Catalonia was 11.69 per 1,000 inhabitants, and the infant mortality
rate was 2.66 per 1,000 live births. The government of Catalonia
provides free public health services to everyone (as occurs in the
rest of Spain) and has developed a network of 80 early intervention clinics for children from 0 to 6 years of age. It was in this setting that I began working with a group of psychology professors
at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. In collaboration with
neonatology pediatricians at the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, we
initiated research to examine a range of perinatal factors affecting
development in the neonatal period. The Hospital Clinic is a level
III university hospital, affiliated with the Universitat de Barcelona,
at which there were 4,100 births in 2007.

We decided that our first step would be to familiarize ourselves
with the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) to see how
it could be applied to our unique research setting in Barcelona. Our
initial results provided vital data on the reliability of the NBAS
(our analysis indicated consistent interrater agreement among
examiners). In addition, there were numerous aspects of its theoretical framework that convinced us that the NBAS would be the
most appropriate instrument for our clinical research.'* Our main
research objective was (and still is) to examine various risk factors
and their effects on neonatal development, so we could provide
clinically relevant information that would enable clinics to improve

conditions for newborns in neonatology units. In addition to facilitating our formal research program, the NBAS has been extremely
valuable in helping us understand the complexities of neonatal
psychic structure. For this reason, another of our primary academic
activities is to offer training courses on the NBAS for psychologists,
pediatricians, and nurses throughout Catalonia and Spain, with
the result that the NBAS is being used in different early intervention settings across the country.

BEHAVIORAL STUDIES OF

AT-RISK NEWBORNS

From the moment of birth, there are a series of factors—both biological and psychological—that can affect a child’s development.
While advances in modern medicine have reduced the impact of
many perinatal risk factors, there are many others—such as the
adverse effects of prenatal toxic substances, low birthweight and
prematurity—that have remained unchanged or have even
increased. In order to address these issues, we have studied the
immediate effects on neonatal behavior of such factors, including
birthweight (both low and high), serum bilirubin levels, umbilical
cord lead levels, acute fetal distress, and gestational and pregestational diabetes, as well as cesarean delivery and prematurity in
order to thereby improve future early intervention programs.

All the children in these studies were assessed on the third day
after birth (when they were between 60 and 84 hours old) because
this immediate postnatal period is considered the most reliable
age for conducting a single NBAS evaluation. The evaluations
took place in the Neonatology Unit at the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, with the prior agreement of the parents. They were always
conducted in a quiet room, with very low lighting, at a room
temperature of 25°C to 26°C, and, as recommended by the NBAS
manual, midway between feedings. The examinations were carried out by examiners trained to a 90% to 100% interrater reliability level of agreement, often with two examiners scoring the
examination. We used the first and second editions of the NBAS
until 1995; from then on, we used the third edition, which was
translated into Spanish by our team.°**° With the exception of the
low birthweight study, we analyzed the results according to
the seven clusters proposed by Lester et al: Habituation,
Orientation, Motor, Range of State, Regulation of State, Autonomic
Stability, and Reflexes.°

EFFECTS OF LOW BIRTHWEIGHT AND
HIGH BIRTHWEIGHT

Low BIRTHWEIGHT
Children born with birthweights below normal—small-for-dates
newborns—are considered to be at risk because they have experienced intrauterine growth retardation. Clinical experience has
proven that as they grow older, they are likely to exhibit different
types of problems that affect not only their physical health, but also
their learning abilities. For this study, two groups of full-term
infants were selected. The underweight group comprised 41 smallfor-dates, full-term newborns whose birthweights were below the
10th percentile, based on postmenstrual age. The infants had a
mean birthweight of 2,598 g, with none showing severe signs of
undernourishment. The control group comprised a matched sample of 41 full-term neonates whose birthweights were between the
25th and 75th percentiles, with a mean of 3,392 g.

Six clusters of neonatal behavior were derived from the NBAS®
raw scores: Interaction, Orientation, Motor, Range of State, Consolability, and Energy. Analysis of variance demonstrated that underweight infants scored lower than the control group on the
Interaction and Orientation clusters (p < .01) as well as the Motor
and Energy clusters (p < .001). However, no differences were found
on the Range of State cluster, and there was a small but significant
difference found on the Consolability cluster (p < .05). Underweight infants also scored lower on elicited responses, especially
on the Rooting reflex (p < .01), the Crawling and Moro reflexes
(p < .05), and the Passive Movement (p < .001). From these data,
we can conclude that the behavior of low birthweight newborns, in
comparison with newborns of appropriate birthweight, is characterized by greater difficulty in attending to stimuli, poorer response
to interpersonal interactions, poorer tonic-postural adaptation, and
greater difficulty with self-quieting and consolability. Considering
the impact of this behavioral profile on caregiving adults, it is possible that underweight infants offer less positive reinforcement
than do infants of average weight.””

HIGH BIRTHWEIGHT NEWBORNS

Children born with birthweights above normal—large for gestational age (LGA)—are also at risk. They have higher morbidity and
mortality rates than newborns of appropriate weight, as well as a
greater incidence of morbidity caused by factors such as neonatal

## Page 298

44, CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
asphyxia and metabolic and hematological problems. For our study
of high birthweight infants, the study group comprised 20 full-term
newborns with weights between 4,000 and 4,920 g, which is above
the 90th percentile, based on postmenstrual age. The control group
comprised 35 full-term newborns of appropriate weight, between
3,000 and 3,770 g. LGA newborns performed less well than newborns in the control group on the NBAS Orientation cluster (p < .01)
and on the Regulation of State cluster (p < .05).°

In another study comparing low and high birthweight infants,
the results suggest poor NBAS performance in both groups. However, among low birthweight infants, we observed lower scores on
the items relating to the Motor and Autonomic Stability clusters,
probably influenced by the nutritional state of the organism.’

SERUM BILIRUBIN LEVELS AND
NEONATAL BEHAVIOR

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most common clinical
problems in the first days of life. There are a range of negative outcomes associated with hyperbilirubinemia, such as disorders of
motor development in the first year and alterations of neurological
development and hypoacusia in the first decade of life. In this
study, we used the NBAS>? to conduct a blind evaluation of 73 newborns. Total bilirubin was determined at 72 hours of life. The mean
bilirubin value was 123.12 wmol/L (7.2 mg/dL); the standard deviation, 71.8 pmol/L (4.2 mg/dL); and the range, 17.1 to 273.6 umol/L
(1-16 mg/dL). In order to avoid unnecessary tests, blood extracted
for early endocrine-metabolic screening was used (at that point
no child in the sample had been subject to phototherapy or any
other therapeutic measure). The relationship between bilirubin levels and NBAS scores for behavioral variables was established using
the Pearson correlation test. Results showed an inverse correlation
between elevated bilirubin levels and scores on the following NBAS
clusters: Habituation to tactile stimuli (p = .03); Orientation, especially to auditory stimuli (p = .000); and Motor (p = .0051). These
data may be compatible with disorders previously mentioned.”

UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD LEAD LEVELS AND

NEONATAL BEHAVIOR

There are numerous studies that highlight the negative impact of
lead on children’s cognitive development, especially as it affects
their visual-motor and visual-spatial coordination. Our umbilical
cord lead study was designed to evaluate possible short-term

## Page 299

Perinatal Factors Influencing Development: Spain 45
neurobehavioral consequences for the newborn exposed to lead in
utero at levels that, today, are regarded as safe. Thirty healthy newborns (13 girls and 17 boys) were recruited for the study. Special
emphasis was put on ascertaining that the mothers had no medical
problems in their histories; newborns of mothers with a history of
smoking, alcohol consumption, or other drug use were excluded.
Lead levels were measured in cord blood specimens. Cord blood
samples were obtained in the delivery room, collected in plastic
tubes with heparinlithium as an anticoagulant, and kept in the
refrigerator at 4°C until processed. Lead levels were measured by
atomic absorption spectrophotometry and processed in the Laboratory of Toxicology at the Hospital Clinic of the University of
Barcelona. Cord blood lead was detected in all subjects: The frequency distribution ranged from 1.9 to 15 wg/dL (mean 6.48,
median 5.8, standard deviation 3.24).

Negative correlations have previously been found between cord
blood lead levels and scores on the NBAS.* Using an alternative
method of analysis, a comparison of NBAS cluster scores was carried out after the subjects were classified into two subgroups,
according to their lead levels (above or below the median). Mean
NBAS scores in both groups were compared and differences evaluated by a two-tailed t test for differences between means. No significant differences between the two groups were found based on
gender ratio, postmenstrual age, or somatic characteristics of the
infants with lead levels above or below the median (5.8 wg/dL).
However, significant differences were found when the NBAS cluster scores of the two groups were compared. For all NBAS clusters,
except for Range of State, the neonates with lead levels above the
median obtained significantly lower scores than those in the group
with lead levels below the median. In addition, the correlation
between lead levels and the Habituation, Orientation, Regulation
of State, Range of State, and Autonomic Stability clusters showed a
statistically significant negative correlation with blood lead levels.

Behavior scores of neonates evaluated in this investigation were
all within the normal range. However, newborns with higher cord
blood lead levels showed lower scores in the Habituation, Orientation, and Regulation of State clusters, and they seemed to have
more difficulty in self-quieting and in their self-regulatory activity
and were less well able to habituate to auditory stimuli."

EFFECTS OF ACUTE FETAL DISTRESS
Acute fetal distress is common during the neonatal period
(occurring in 2% to 5% of newborns). Generally, it occurs during

## Page 300

46 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
birth and is a high-risk situation because of the lesions that can be
caused, particularly to the central nervous system. This study evaluated the effects of fetal distress associated with metabolic acidosis
(pH < 7.15 and BE< —8 in blood samples from the umbilical
artery) on neonatal behavior. We compared 15 anoxic neonates
with a sample of 87 newborns with the same characteristics, but
whose pH and BE levels were normal (pH > 7.25 and BE > 5).
Statistically significant differences were found between the two
groups. The control group performed much better than the hypoxic
group on almost all of the NBAS clusters.° The following results
were obtained with Student’s t test: Habituation (p < .001), Orientation (p < .001), Autonomic Stability (p < .001), Regulation of State
(p < .01), and Motor (p < .001). These data indicate that hypoxic
neonates exhibit greater irritability and hypersensitivity to stimuli
than nonhypoxic newborns. This means they have more difficulty
in habituating to repetitive disturbing stimuli, as well as more difficulty remaining attentive and responding to external sensory
stimuli. In addition, infants who have experienced fetal distress at
the time of birth are less predisposed to interaction, have poorer
general motor aptitude, and have lower capability for internal
organization and regulation of states. In general, then, it seems that
these babies lack the resources to recover their internal equilibrium
after a phase of irritation, such as crying, because they find it more
difficult to console themselves. In addition, there is evidence to
suggest that they have a poor capacity to respond appropriately
to situations of stress that require readjustment of the autonomous
nervous system.”

NEWBORNS OF DIABETIC MOTHERS
Nowadays, with correct metabolic and obstetric control, the most
likely prognosis in cases of gestational and pregestational diabetes
is a normal outcome for both the mother and her child. To determine whether neonates born to mothers with gestational and
pregestational diabetes show any differences in behavior from those
born to healthy mothers, the NBAS* was administered to 50 newborns. The study group comprised 15 neonates born to mothers
with gestational diabetes (Al and A2) and 3 born to mothers with
pregestational diabetes mellitus Type 1. The control group comprised 32 neonates born to healthy mothers. Diabetes control was
determined by means of glycohemoglobin plasma levels (HbA1)
and the absence of macrosomia.

## Page 302

Perinatal Factors Influencing Development: Spain 47

The results showed no significant differences among groups in
any of the NBAS clusters that make up the scale. Apart from that,
HbA1 levels of the mothers during gestation were always within
normal limits. Thus, as was expected, in this case, the NBAS
detected no differences in the behavior of neonates born to mothers
with gestational diabetes that was correctly controlled during
pregnancy."

FULL-TERM CESAREAN SECTION
NEWBORN INFANTS
The objective of this research was to study the behavior of normal,
full-term newborns delivered by cesarean section and to compare
their behavior with that of normal full-term newborn infants delivered vaginally. The study included two groups of 15 neonates whose
mothers had been given epidural or intradural analgesia and had
similar characteristics. The infants in the study group had been
delivered by cesarean section, while those in the control group had
been delivered vaginally. Comparison of the neonates’ behavior
showed no statistically significant differences in any of the NBAS
clusters.’ The scores of infants born by cesarean section were, in fact,
higher—although not significantly so—than those of the infants
born by vaginal delivery. From an analysis of the individual items, a
significant difference was observed for Pull-to-Sit in the Motor cluster, favoring those born by cesarean (5.73 versus 3.93; p < .05), but
this difference is not clinically significant. Given these results, it may
be concluded that, in this case, cesarean section, practiced with epidural or intradural analgesia, did not influence neonatal behavior,
as evaluated on the third day of age, on the NBAS."
BEHAVIOR OF PREMATURE NEWBORNS
AT 40 POSTMENSTRUAL WEEKS

A newborn is considered premature when it is born before 37 postmenstrual weeks. Studies of the risks associated with prematurity at
the psychopathological level look at different aspects, both cognitive and psychomotor (or behavioral) in nature. The objective of this
research was the detection of the earliest signs of such problems.
The study compared a group of 30 premature infants born between
27 and 34 weeks with a control group of 30 healthy, full-term newborn infants. The assessment of neonatal behavior with the NBAS®
was catried out at 38 to 40 postmenstrual weeks for the study group
and at 60 to 84 hours after birth for the control group.

## Page 303

48 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

In comparing the behaviors of the two groups, we found statistically significant differences, with lower scores in the State Organization (p = .021) and State Regulation (p = .003) clusters for the
prematurely born newborns. We found no differences for the other
clusters, except in the case of the Habituation cluster, where the
results for premature neonates exceeded those of the control group,
specifically in the case of their response to auditory stimuli.

The lowest scores observed in premature neonates—that is, in
the State Organization and State Regulation clusters—include
items related to control and self-regulation mechanisms in response
to stimulation from their surroundings. In this case, it is plausible that premature neonates have already learned to cope with
auditory stimulation in the NICU, and this is demonstrated by better results for Habituation, since they had to develop this capacity
throughout their extrauterine experience of between 6 and 13
weeks. However, they have few resources with which to control
their states, and so are poorly equipped to defend themselves
against the indiscriminate stimulation of their environment."

CONCLUSION
In our work in Barcelona, the NBAS has proven to be a very sensitive technique for detecting deficits in at-risk newborns. As we had
expected, in almost all cases, the groups of at-risk neonates we
studied scored consistently lower than the control groups (the
exceptions were the babies of diabetic mothers and those born by
cesarean section). It is important to remember that these results
must be treated and applied with caution, since their statistical significance may not always be clinically meaningful. That being said,
the score profiles of at-risk neonates in our series of studies indicated a fragility that was reflected in the behavioral parameters we
observed. The infants’ poor ability to respond to external stimuli
and their lack of resources to defend themselves from persistent
environmental stimulation seem to compromise their stability. Yet
the behavioral disturbances, which can affect the future development of these newborns, are not readily noticeable in a routine
physical examination during their early days of life. Fortunately,
we now know that they can be detected using very sensitive
methods, such as the NBAS. All of the data provided by our
research indicate that the NBAS is a most appropriate instrument
for revealing behavioral deficits, as well as developmental disorders caused by adverse perinatal factors. It provides clinicians with
a description of the neonate’s behavioral profile that is vital in order

SHOHEI OHGI anp TOMITARO AKIYAMA
We have been using the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale
(NBAS) for early assessment of infants at high risk for developmental disorders such as cerebral palsy and mental retardation and
have found it to be a valuable tool for managing early intervention.’* The NBAS is the best instrument we know of for objectively
assessing high-risk infants because its fundamental principle is to
identify the individual characteristics and capabilities of each
infant—information that is extremely useful in planning early
intervention.** At the heart of caring for at-risk infants is the necessity of seeing each one as a unique person, with a unique set of personality traits, responses, and behaviors. In assessing infants with
cerebral palsy and/or mental retardation, we believe it is more
important to find out what they can do (their positive abilities) than
to identify what is abnormal. A core principle of our treatment is
that appropriate assessment of ability is essential for optimal care.

We present here a summary of our work in Japan, as well as the

clinical and research implications of what we have learned.

PREDICTION STUDIES OF LATER
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES

It is important to understand the neonatal neurobehavioral charac
teristics of at-risk infants in order to formulate appropriate inter
vention plans for their developmental care. Care plans that center

on the neonatal behavioral organization of these infants facilitate

development by enhancing parenting skills, improving parental
recognition of their infants’ abilities, and promoting the parentinfant relationship. The NBAS has been widely used for this purpose. When the NBAS examination is administered to assess a
behaviorally disorganized, high-risk infant, it can provide information to guide the clinician in planning intervention and can also
support both the infant and the family by helping parents recognize and understand their infant’s behavioral characteristics.
NEONATAL BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT SCALE

AND LATER DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN

Low BIRTHWEIGHT INFANTS

From the clinical standpoint, we have analyzed the relationship
between NBAS scores and developmental outcomes in low birthweight infants, and find the NBAS to be a useful tool in assessing the
risk of future developmental disabilities.© This study analyzed
the relationship between NBAS scores during the neonatal period
and developmental outcomes at 5 years of age. It included 209 eligible low birthweight infants. The NBAS assessment was performed
three times: at the postmenstrual age of 36 to 38 weeks (preterm), 40
to 42 weeks (term), and 44 to 46 weeks (postterm). The 5-year outcome was assessed using neurological examinations, imaging techniques, intelligence development tests (McCarthy Scales),° and
behavioral problems questionnaires. Developmental outcomes were
categorized in three groups: Normal, Mild Disability, and Severe
Disability. The Normal group included children with no distinguishable motor, mental, or behavioral problems. The Mild Disability
group included children with motor delay and/or slight mental
development and/or behavioral problems. The Severe Disability
group included those with cerebral palsy and/or mental delay and/
or epilepsy and/or visual-auditory impairment. The NBAS cluster
scores at each assessment period were compared among the three
groups. Behavioral cluster scores (Habituation, Orientation, Motor,
Range of State, State Regulation, Autonomic Stability) were significantly lower, and Reflexes cluster scores were significantly higher in
the Mild and Severe Disability groups than in the Normal group.
These results suggest that lower scores on the Behavioral clusters,
and higher scores on the Reflexes cluster in the neonatal period, are
reliable predictors of later developmental disabilities. These results
also suggest that, in the neonatal period, infants with developmental
disabilities have poorer motor control, less responsiveness to environmental stimuli, less regulatory capacity, poorer state regulation,

Supporting Parents of At-Risk Infants: Japan 53
and depressed reflexes, compared to developmentally normal
infants. The results of multinomial logistic regression analysis show
that at postterm age, the risk of later Mild Disability is more closely
related to lower Behavioral cluster scores, such as Motor, Orientation, and State systems; whereas the risk of Severe Disability is
strongly associated with neurological abnormality (higher Reflexes
cluster scores). Signs of abnormality were more apparent in the
Behavioral clusters for the Mild Disability group, while the Reflexes
cluster at postterm age was the best predictor of the Severe Disability
group. Comparing predictions of developmental outcomes based on
the multinomial logistic model with actual outcomes, results show
that 94% to 97% of the subjects in the Normal group, 50% to 78% in
the Mild Disability group, and 71% to 85% in the Severe Disability
group were correctly classified by the model. The overall proportion
of correct prediction was highest—reaching 91.7%—at postterm age,
suggesting that it is possible to differentiate the Normal group from
the Mild or Severe Disability groups with a high degree of accuracy
at term age. This high level of accuracy suggests the usefulness of the
NBAS as a method for predicting developmental disabilities.
NEONATAL BEHAVIORAL CHARACTERISTICS AND LATER
BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS
With a view to developing an early intervention plan for infants at
risk of later behavioral problems, the aims of this study were: (a) to
evaluate the usefulness of the NBAS as a tool to assess the risk of
later behavioral problems; and (b) to carry out an analysis of the relationship between neonatal behavioral characteristics and behavioral
problems in childhood.’ Seventy-seven very low birthweight infants
made up the final sample. For children 7 to 8 years of age, behavior
problems were diagnosed based on the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.)* and the Strengths and
Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).’ In comparing NBAS cluster scores
of infants with and without later behavioral problems, we found that
Orientation, Motor, and State Control cluster scores were significantly lower in those with later behavioral problems than in those
without behavioral problems. In other words, infants with later
behavioral problems had deficiencies that were identified in their
neonatal behavioral developmental systems, as compared to infants
without such problems. These results suggest that weak behavioral
regulation systems in the neonatal period are predictors of later
behavioral problems. The odds ratios estimated by the logistic regression model at selected terms showed that lower Motor, State Control

## Page 309

54 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

(average of the Range of State and State Regulation cluster scores)
and Orientation cluster scores were associated with a significantly
increased risk of later behavioral problems. The results of this study
show that neonatal behavioral characteristics, such as poor motor
performance, poor state regulation and poor interaction ability in the
neonatal developmental stage are risk factors of behavioral problems
in later childhood.

In summary, these results suggest that the NBAS, when used
serially in the postnatal period, can help clinicians develop a management protocol for infants at risk for later developmental disabilities, as well as identify neonates who are at high risk of later
developmental disabilities.

EARLY INTERVENTION FOR INFANTS
AND MOTHERS AT RISK

Previous studies of early, family-centered intervention based on
the NBAS—for both healthy newborns and premature infants—
have shown positive effects on infant-mother interactions and
developmental outcomes.?*0"78 This NBAS-based intervention
was designed to facilitate the development of infants by enhancing
parenting skills and improving parental recognition of infants’
abilities. We believe a family-centered approach based on the NBAS
should take precedence over a disabilities-focused approach in the
first stage of planning early intervention for at-risk infants.
STRATEGY FOR EARLY INTERVENTION

Early intervention planning for at-risk infants has conventionally
been centered on the infants’ disabilities, rather than on the family’s
adjustment. In at-risk groups, it is especially important for parents
to be able to adapt their parenting styles based on the infant’s behavioral repertoire and the severity of the infant’s symptoms. Our intervention strategy has two major components (Table 5.1). The first is
to facilitate infant-mother interactions using NBAS-based intervention. NBAS-based intervention requires the parent(s) to observe the
baby during a demonstration of the NBAS examination. The infant
specialist then comments on—and discusses—the baby’s behavior
(strengths and weaknesses, attempts at self-regulation) and demonstrates how parents can recognize and support their infant’s coping strategies and respond to their infant in ways that will be
developmentally beneficial. The goal is to optimize caregiving interactions by enhancing the mother’s adjustment to her infant’s

advise the mother on specific ways to handle her infant based on
the child’s abilities and developmental needs. Figure 5.1 summarizes the early intervention program for at-risk infants and their
parents. It is performed three to four times, lasts about 30 minutes
per session prior to discharge from the NICU, typically taking place
at 36 to 40 weeks postmenstrual age. Advising a mother about car
ing for her infant is begun with rooming in, and then continues at a

follow-up clinic, at the rehabilitation unit, and/or with home visits

once every week or every other week after discharge.

promotes maternal mental health as well as the developmental
progress of low birthweight infants with cerebral injuries.’* Subjects were 23 high-risk, low birthweight infants (15 with preventricular leukomalacia, 5 with intraventricular hemorrhage, and 3
with both). Subjects were randomly assigned, 12 to the EIP group,
and 11 to the control group. Participants in the EIP group received
an NBAS-based intervention combined with developmental support designed to enhance the infants’ development and the quality
of the parent-infant relationship. The control group received routine medical-nursing care without the EIP. The EIP began prior to
discharge from the NICU and lasted until 6 months of corrected
age. All children were examined using the NBAS preintervention
and again at 44 weeks postmenstrual age. Maternal anxiety status
(State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI])'* and maternal feelings of
confidence in dealing with her baby (Lack of Confidence in Caregiving [LCC] items of the Mother and Baby Scale)’® were measured pre- and postintervention. Mental and motor development
were assessed postintervention using the Bayley Scale of Infant
Development.'” Orientation and State Regulation behavioral profiles, as well as the STAI and LCC scores, significantly improved in
the EIP group, but not in the control group. The Bayley Mental
Development Index (MDI) score in the EIP group was higher than

in the control group, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Overall, then, our results indicated
that the EIP had beneficial effects on neonatal neurobehavioral
development and maternal mental health of low birthweight
infants with cerebral injuries. This evidence suggests that shortterm changes in maternal mental health and infant neurobehavior
promoted by an EIP may serve to initiate a positive interaction
between parents and infants.

NBAS-BASED INTERVENTION FOR INFANTS WITH

DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES

We studied infants with developmental disabilities and their mothers in order to investigate the effectiveness of the same NBAS-based
intervention described in the previous section, to enhance infant
neurobehavioral organization, maternal self-efficacy, and motherinfant interaction.'® A time-series study design was used, with the
intervention trial consisting of a 2-week observation at baseline,
which was followed by the NBAS-based intervention. The study
was designed to examine the efficacy of the NBAS-based intervention on infants’ neurobehavior, on maternal self-efficacy, and on
mother-infant interaction. Study subjects consisted of 13 infants
with disabilities (6 with cystic periventricular leukomalacia, 3 with
chromosomal anomaly, 1 with birth asphyxia, 1 with holoprosencephaly, 1 with congenital multiple arthrogryposis, 1 with RussellSilver syndrome) and their mothers. The NBAS, LCC, and the
Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS)” were used to
assess neonatal neurobehavior, maternal self-efficacy, and the quality of mother-infant interaction, respectively, at three time points:
at intake, preintervention, and postintervention. The NBAS-based
intervention consisted of parental observation of the NBAS exam
conducted by the infant specialist, followed by discussion of the
infant’s behavioral characteristics, and demonstration of intervention strategies to attune mothers to their infants’ behaviors. Intervention sessions were held six to eight times, 30 minutes per session,
during the intervention period. Results showed that the NBAS Orientation and State Regulation cluster scores, the LCC score, and the
NCATS Caregiver Total and Subscale scores (Sensitivity to Cues and
Social-Emotional Growth Fostering) were significantly improved
postintervention. This study suggests that the NBAS-based intervention has beneficial effects on neonatal neurobehavioral organization of infants with developmental disabilities and on the quality
of mother-infant interaction skills and maternal self-efficacy

in caring for such infants. The study also shows that attunement of
mothers to their infants’ behaviors early in life may promote a positive cycle of interaction between parents and infants.
CONCLUSION
Our studies provide strong evidence that the NBAS is a reliable
tool for predicting later developmental disabilities in low birthweight and premature infants. Further, we found that, when used
serially in the postnatal period, the NBAS can help clinicians not
only to identify neonates who are at high risk of behavioral problems in childhood, but also to develop individualized management
protocols for infants at risk for later developmental disabilities.

CHAPTER 6
The Cultural Context of the
Mother-Infant Relationship:
Korea
YEONGHEE SHIN anp BYUNGHI PARK

Considering how little of the literature on Korean practices of childbearing and childrearing is known to Western society, it seems
appropriate to begin with a historical perspective. There are three
major influences affecting pregnancy, birth, and neonatal care in
Korea—shamanistic beliefs, ancient Chinese philosophy, and Western medical philosophy. Theories and practices of Chinese medical
arts heavily influenced ancient Korean culture. Among these are
acupuncture and chi theory yin-yang theory and the arts of medicine, numerology, and astrology. These became a part of Korean
heritage and remain so today in the form of several research institutes and schools of oriental medicine.

In 1884, the North American Presbyterian Church sent medical
missionaries to establish a hospital and medical school in Seoul;
this was the beginning of Western medical practice in Korea.’ From
1910 to 1945, Korea survived 36 years of annexation to Japan, and
after that, two devastating wars in succession—World War II and
the Korean War. In the decades since, Korea has been reborn as a
technological society. Yet, ancient folk beliefs and traditions toward
pregnancy, birth, and postpartum practices were retained until well
into the 1980s.”

Traditional cultural practices related to childbearing and childrearing that are unique to Korea included Tae Mong (a conception
dream), Tae Kyo (a set of rules for safe childbirth), and instructions
for postpartum-newborn care and breastfeeding.” Ancient Koreans
believed in Tae Mong, a dream in which a woman would see various
60

images before conceiving. The oldest Tae Mong story was recorded
during the Three Dynasty period—kKokuryo (20 Bc to AD 668), Baekjae
(19 Bc to AD 660), and Silla (57 Bc to AD 935). According to this story,
a man prayed to Buddha for a son whom he pledged to dedicate
to a temple. After his pious prayer, his wife had a dream in which “a
star had fallen from the sky and into her arms.” Later, she had a son
who became a famous monk in ancient Korea. There is a similar legend about Genghis Kahn. His mother had a Tae Mong in which she
saw “the sun had fallen from the sky into her womb.” Many Korean
women respect Tae Mong and practice the Tae Kyo ritual for pregnancy. Tae Kyo (the literal translation is “fetal education”) is a set of
rules for safe childbirth, most of which are derived from ancient
Chinese medical philosophy; however, some may have derived
from Buddhism or shamanism. Tae Kyo is meant to maintain physical, as well as mental, well-being during pregnancy in order to protect the fetus. The pregnant woman has to meticulously observe
various taboos, such as avoid killing any living creature and avoid
having contact with anything considered unclean. As parturition
approaches, even more taboos are imposed on the woman and her
family. The pregnant woman must avoid sexual intercourse and
must not consume any sacrificial food; and no type of repair or construction on the home where she lives is allowed. The belief is that if
these taboos are broken, an easy and safe childbirth may not be
assured, the fetus may contract a disease or be born retarded, or a
stillbirth may result. Some of these taboos have a rationale in terms
of contemporary Western medical concepts. Today, Korean woman
observe Tae Kyo with varying degrees of strictness. Part of current
Tae Kyo practice includes reading classical literature, appreciating
art objects, and keeping a serene and optimistic attitude during
pregnancy.

In former times, when all Tae Kyo traditions were strictly followed, males and childless women were not allowed to be in the
room during labor and delivery. After childbirth, the new mother
typically would eat seaweed soup and rice. Any food other than
seaweed soup was believed to be harmful for the new mother. A
sound basis for this tradition is probably the fact that seaweed soup
supplements salts (Na, K, Cl, Ca, Mg, and I), as well as the water
lost during labor; and replacing these helps prepare the new mother’s body for lactation. Cold beverages were absolutely forbidden
because they were thought to harm the mother’s teeth. No household members except those responsible for the care of the mother
and the infant were allowed to enter the birth chamber for 7 days,
and both mother and infant were usually confined to bed for from

## Page 318

62 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

3 to 21 days after birth. Any members of the family who had
traveled before the infant was born were not permitted to enter the
new mother’s room until 21 days postpartum. This rule seems to
be equivalent to the concept of quarantine.

Traditionally, mothers were always encouraged to begin breastfeeding as early as possible because early lactation was known to be
critical for the safety and survival of the infant. However, the rate of
breastfeeding in Korea has declined steadily since the 1980s. By the
early 1990s, only one in four mothers breastfed their babies.? Even
worse, by the year 2000, particularly among highly educated middleclass women, even fewer women were breastfeeding their infants.*”

The decline of breastfeeding has been attributed to a number of
factors: the industrialization of Korea, the improvement of women’s social status, the migration of the population into metropolitan
areas, and the shift away from the extended family structure, leaving young mothers isolated and more independent in their small
nuclear families. Without the kind of social support that used to
exist, far fewer young women breastfeed. Despite the campaigns of
both nurses’ and physicians’ academic societies, the trend away
from breastfeeding is difficult to reverse. Historically, the merits of
breastfeeding have been appreciated in Korea—not only the immunological benefits but also the emotional benefits of the interaction
between mother and infant. In 1995, Elizabeth Chong Choi lamented
the fact that the influence of Western medicine has altered traditional perinatal care practice in Korea, to the detriment of both
infants’ and mothers’ well-being.’

EVALUATING NEWBORNS WITH NBAS AND
OTHER SCALES

The mother-infant dyad is the primary relationship on which all
other social relationships are built. The nature and importance of
mother-infant interaction, therefore, has been studied extensively.
In particular, the work of both Bowlby and Ainsworth has inspired
and greatly influenced subsequent researchers. This dyadic motherinfant relationship apparently starts long before the birth. Recent
evidence from basic research shows that the fetus remembers the
mother’s voice (the fetus responds to sounds as early as 22 to 24
weeks in utero), and newborns demonstrate a remarkable ability to
recognize their mothers’ faces shortly after birth.° Even before these
basic research results were reported, Brazelton, in his seminal work,
recognized the neonate’s role in the mother-infant relationship.’

The Cultural Context of the Mother-Infant Relationship: Korea 63
Behavioral studies of Korean newborns and mother-infant interactions are relatively few. In 2004, Shin and colleagues conducted a
study of Korean newborns by examining a sample of 50 full-term
newborns using the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale
(NBAS).° We found that overall similarities with other behavioral
investigations suggested both universal and culture-specific characteristics of Korean newborns.’”" As shown in Table 6.1, our findings reinforced the overall profile of Korean neonates as having
moderate levels of ability in shutting out disturbing stimuli and in
responding to social stimulation; they also showed high levels of
ability in State Organization, State Regulation, and Autonomic Stability. We found that Korean newborns appeared less skilled in
shutting out disturbing stimuli and in taking part in social interaction than other study groups including Indonesian," CaucasianAmerican,!* and Swedish neonates.”

As for the State organization and State Regulation clusters,
Korean neonates did not demonstrate hyper- or hypoactive
responses to stimulation. Their responses to disturbing stimuli
were tolerant, rarely reaching a crying state. This suggests that
Korean newborns are agreeable and manageable, which may make
them easier to care for, a characteristic that may, in turn, promote
attachment. Performance on Motor, State Organization, State Regulation, and Autonomic stability clusters was similar to, or even
better than, those of other cultural groups, for which we have comparable data.""”'8 Another notable finding was that a significant
number of Korean newborns showed poor walking and standing
reflexes. Notable, too, was the fact that newborns whose mothers
worked during pregnancy showed significantly higher scores on
Social Interactive scores. It is likely that these working mothers had
more active lives, both mentally and socially, during their pregnancies than nonworking mothers. Thus, the mothers’ active lifestyles
may have affected neonatal behavior performance.

In 2003, Shin and colleagues conducted a pilot research project
in which a group of orphaned infants were screened for physical
abnormalities using the NBAS."* Although these infants were free
of any physical defects, we observed that their facial expressions
were blank and lacked emotion. We decided to study the effects of
daily multiple-sensory stimulation (auditory, visual, tactile, and
vestibular) on their development. Within only 4 weeks, we found
the faces of infants in this intervention group to be bright, with
responsive smiles. Furthermore, when compared to the control
group at 1 and 6 months, the intervention group showed significantly higher weight gain, an increase of head circumference, and

fewer illnesses and hospital visits. In summary, we found that the
multiple-sensory stimulation and human contact provided by a
caregiver on a daily basis seemed helpful for the development of
orphaned newborns, perhaps compensating, on some basic level,
for the lack of a mother.

Korean investigators have observed mother-infant interactions
in several different studies. In 2003, Seon-Ah Lee and Shin educated primipara mothers about their infants’ behavioral characteristics by demonstrating the NBAS and subsequently measured the
effects on the mother-infant play interaction using the scale developed by Walker and colleagues.’'’ As shown in Table 6.2, there was
a significant difference between the scores of the intervention and
control groups on the measure of mother-child interaction, with
the intervention mothers scoring higher on the overall quality of
their interactions with their infants. Similar results had been
reported in earlier studies.*’© Our investigation further showed
that when maternal education was factored in, the demonstration
of the NBAS improved not just mother-infant interaction but infant
behavior, too: The behavioral scores of the infants in the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the infants in the
control group in specific behavioral domains.’ Social Interaction
and State Regulation scores of intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group. The Habituation
score was also higher, but not to a degree that was statistically significant. Overall, our study results are consistent with the results
earlier reported by Hae-Kyung Lim.* Therefore, we concluded that
inexperienced young mothers and their children benefit significantly from an NBAS-based maternal education program.

CONTRIBUTION OF THE NBAS TO KOREAN
MOTHERS AND CHILDREN
In October of 1997, Dr. Brazelton and Dr. Kevin Nugent made their
first visit to Keimyung University at the invitation of President Synn
and held the first Brazelton conference and NBAS workshop in
Daegu, Korea. Similar conferences held subsequently, along with
the translation of the NBAS manual into Korean " elicited considerable interest in neonatal behavioral research among nurse researchers. However, many nurses and physicians found that the NBAS
required too much delicate handling of newborn babies, to the point
where it was not easy to complete the examination reliably in a short
time period without very good skills. Nevertheless, despite the extra
time and effort that the NBAS requires, we have found that the

The Cultural Context of the Mother-Infant Relationship: Korea 67
NBAS can be effective in identifying any abnormalities or behavioral problems that have been overlooked prior to discharge. Therefore, this exam may be the best simple and cost-effective screening
method available in a variety of clinical settings.

Industrialization-induced population drift to urban areas, an
increase of women’s employment, and improvement in women’s
status have all contributed to an erosion of traditional cultural practices related to childbearing and childrearing in Korea. A young couple in their own small nuclear family does not have anyone to bother
them with anachronistic preaching. By the same token, they also
have no one to advise them about breastfeeding or newborn care.
Bottle-feeding in Korea is now at its highest recorded level. In the
past several years, education related to pregnancy, labor, and delivery has been left primarily to nurses, physicians, and other experts in
the field, with family members playing a less important role in advising and guiding new parents. In addition, many informational
resources such as books and pamphlets are available. We are not
suggesting that the age of technology is necessarily a bad thing. Educational television channels and Internet sites (such as www.momilk.
co.kr) provide helpful information and a variety of good programs;
some of these discuss Tae Mong, Tae Kyo, and a variety of ancient traditions, as well as providing up-to-date medical information.

We believe that the education of expectant mothers or primiparas through the NBAS is an ideal way of increasing each mother’s sensitivity to understanding her baby’s cues. This sensitivity
may, in turn, enhance physical and emotional bonding between
mothers and their newborns. In addition, we have found that the
NBAS can be a wonderful tool for identifying developmental disabilities among premature infants, institutionalized infants, or
infants from families with low socioeconomic status. Early intervention with NBAS for high-risk babies offers significant benefits.
A large and consistent body of research proves the efficacy of this
kind of early intervention.'®'?707!

CHAPTER 7
Moments of Meeting:
Pivotal Moments in Mother,
Infant, Father Bonding:
Switzerland
NADIA BRUSCHWEILER-STERN
This chapter addresses the therapeutic effect of neonatal intervention
with the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and, more
specifically, very particular moments of the consultation known as
“moments of meeting.”’? A moment of meeting is a moment of
change in the relational process, as described in the work of the
Boston Change Process Study Group (BCPSG) when studying the
therapeutic process.**” The focus here will be on moments of meeting between mother and infant, moments which, in our Western
societies, typically occur during the first days or weeks of life. I see
them as a sign of recognition between the partners that jumps the
relationship and their attachment to a higher level and as an important step in establishing the new family triad.
NOW MOMENTS—MOMENTS OF MEETING
In a relationship, a tension is generated when an unpredictable
event arises that disturbs the current equilibrium. This creates a
“now moment.”(NM). Attention is drawn to the present. How will
I deal with this situation? What do I do? Fight? Flee? Or freeze?
This is a moment of change. Right before a change, the elements of
the old equilibrium are not steady anymore; they are volatile and
can easily go wrong.
70

## Page 328

Moments of Meeting 71

To best relieve this tension, it is necessary to have a moment of
meeting. Such moments have the potential not only to reequilibrate
the relationship, but to jump it to a higher level. Birth is such a
crisis, since the arrival of a baby upsets the previous equilibrium
and, as a result, natural tensions arise for mother, baby, and father.
A moment of meeting among them resolves these tensions and
moves them to a new state. What I am addressing here are tiny
instants on the order of seconds." It is at this microlevel that life is
lived and gets inscribed intimately as a whole in the body and in
the mind at once. Whether a meeting is achieved can be the beginning of a spiral—either positive or negative—that may become a
characteristic pattern of the relationship.

NATURE OF TENSIONS IN MOTHER, BABY,

AND FATHER
For the mother, two essential elements of the Motherhood Constellation are at play.’”**"° First is the new and permanent sense of
responsibility for ensuring the survival, the growth, and the wellbeing of her baby. A mother asks herself questions such as: How
will I know when he hungry? Or when he has had enough? Why
does he cry? What does he need? Is he in pain? When do I take him
to the doctor?

Second is the need to establish unique ties of attachment and
love with her baby: Will I be able to love him? Will he love me in
return? Will I be able to connect with him? Will I feel he is my own?
These questions preoccupy new mothers. Accordingly, they will
experience a certain level of alertness, vigilance, and anxiety that
reflects their emotional investment in the baby.

On the baby’s side, the newborn seems to have an impulse and a
disposition to connect with his mother, to get to know her, to make
her a coherent and familiar other. He is equipped to be interested in
and oriented toward her:

e¢ He began this work in utero. He has already learned the sound

of her voice, the distinctive cadence of her way of speaking, as
well as her taste and odor, so that when he is born, he can
immediately recognize her as familiar.

¢ When he hears his mother’s voice, he will mobilize himself to

visually find the source of this familiar sound.

e His visual system is built to best see things that occur at a short

distance away, where most mothering activity takes place.

## Page 329

72 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
His mother will naturally be in his field of vision. In this way,
he learns to associate the voice, which he already knows, with
a face, a touch, and a rhythm of motion.

e The maternal voice is particularly stimulating for the baby. He
emerges from his drowsiness, searches to discover where the
sound comes from, tones his body up, turns his head, and
seeks the voice until his gaze finds the eyes of his mother.

e The click of a mutual gaze between baby and mother is a
moment of meeting, a sign of recognition that changes the
inner and interpersonal states of both.

As far as the father is concerned, although he has initiated the
future life and is co-responsible for it, he remains a spectator—a
witness to the pregnancy and delivery. He may be more or less
active and involved in the events surrounding birth, depending on
circumstances, his choice, and his culture. Regardless, the jump
into his new role as a father can feel surrealistic and scary. As he
faces a continuation of his life in the life of this child, which he will
have to help raise, he finds himself in charge of the security of the
family nest. He needs to be gainfully employed. He must also find
his place in the family triad, where suddenly he seems less important because the mother-baby axis has become predominant. He
must remain available to participate without taking the mother’s
place and must develop his own tie with the baby, regulate their
contacts with the surrounding world, and become a solid and stable base while his wife undergoes the highs and lows that result
from the physical, hormonal, and emotional effects of becoming a
mother. These paternal tasks require a good deal of flexibility, a certain understanding of what the mother is going through, and good
communication between the partners.

Because they are so complex and important, the early processes
of triadic interactions are an active area of study."

BEGINNING MATERNAL BONDING
Maternal attachment and bonding does not start at birth, but well
before. From a psychological point of view, the attachment system
is being prepared before and during the pregnancy by the mother’s imaginary exploration of her child-to-be and his place in the
family.

At the moment of birth, the mother usually progresses through
certain steps. Observing situations where these steps could not be

## Page 330

Moments of Meeting 73
fully lived through and resolved has taught me the most about
their importance. Three of these steps are as follows:

1. Survival of the baby emerges as the mother’s first preoccupation. Accordingly, at the moment her baby is born, she first
needs to make sure he is alive. She needs to make him her
own, at an animal level—to physically experience the weight
of his little body on hers, its smell, its texture, to feel him
warm and well, alive on her. It is the end point of the delivery.
The mothers of preterm babies have the same urge to have
their babies in their arms. In the recent past, they had to
wait for weeks for that moment, which brings such a huge
relief that for many mothers that is the moment when he is
finally born.

2. Then, the mother needs to know that everything is fine, that
her baby is anatomically intact and in good health. Seeing her
newborn naked—looking at the face, the genitals, the back,
counting the fingers—and assessing the physical status of the
baby answers her questions and meets this essential need.

3. Once she has been reassured that the baby is normal and
healthy, the mother wants to make the baby her own. She
seeks to meet this new member of the family as a person in
the continuity of her and her husband’s families. She will
search to appropriate him through physical resemblances
(“He has his father’s forehead and eyes, but he has my
mouth!”) and through behavioral similarities (“When he is
hungry, you’ve got to be there right away! He is demanding
like my father,” or “He sleeps a lot. In my family, we are all
ereat sleepers.”).

These steps seem to free the mother to invest in her child.

However, this is not yet a relationship.

CONSULTATION USING THE NBAS”?

During my consultations using the NBAS, I aim to release the tensions described earlier and foster the establishment of a relationship by promoting moments of meeting where the baby will become
a real interlocutor (see Figure 7.1). The parents are my first interlocutors (a); in their presence, the baby will be my next interlocutor
(b); and then in my presence, the parents will discover the baby as
an interlocutor for both of them (c).

Figure 7.1 Axes of Interaction.

I try to create a protective environment for the parents that is
open and spontaneous enough to let them feel free to ask their
questions and let their emotions flow. I begin by listening to them
narrate their respective experiences of the pregnancy and delivery.
Sharing the emotional and practical details of their experience
helps establish a trusting relationship between them and me. I also
listen to their description of their baby as they see him. Only then
do I invite them to see with me what their infant has to tell us about
himself. I get closer to the baby and explain what I will do with him
as I begin to administer the NBAS. The behavior of the infant as he
interacts with me, as well as the parents’ reactions, will guide the
unfolding of the consultation. I aim for the discovery of the baby at
this moment, paying peripheral attention to the parents’ reactions
and their interaction. So my dialogue with them goes on during the
NBAS examination. This early intervention can create moments of
meeting that promote or strengthen the bonding process among
mother and infant and father.

Clinical Examples

Bianca and Her Mother

Bianca was filmed with her mother for a television program about the

newborn competencies revealed through the NBAS. Unfortunately,

the father couldn’t be there. The mother hadn’t asked for a consultation;
this is the reason why I am not engaging with her as fully as I usually do

in a consultation setting. Bianca is a 4-day-old, full-term baby, awake

and alert. She follows my voice as I am talking to her, all the way from

one side to the other. At some point, the camera lens comes into her line

of vision and captures her gaze. Her mother and I talk about this, and
I resume the exam, offering Bianca the red ball to follow.

The mother murmurs, “Incredible! It is incredible!” She pauses, then
adds, “How wonderful!”

Next, I present my face to Bianca and she follows my face as I move
it slowly. “Do you see how attentive she is?” I ask, and we join in admiring Bianca’s capacity, so early in life, to maintain her attention and to
follow with such harmony.

Her mother comments. Bianca hears her mother, and she turns right
toward her. I explain this reaction: “Notice how your voice has stimulated her. Did you see how she looked past my face to find you? She
reacted to your voice.” Bianca’s mother listens to me, looks at her daughter, totally in love, and starts talking to her, “Bianca, are you listening to
me, my little one? Are you listening to Mommy?”

“Had you noticed before that she would turn toward you when hearing your voice?” I ask.

“When I am talking, even if she is lying down like this, she looks
at me,” the mother answers. Once again, Bianca turns her head toward
her mother. Bianca’s attention, senses, and body all turn toward her
mother.

“Look! She is turning toward you,” I point out.

“Yes. Yes. Yes. She turns to my husband, too. She stares at him,” the
mother tells me. There is silence as mother and child gaze at one another.
After a few seconds during which the mother is immersed in her baby’s
eyes, she says, “It’s Mommy, my angel. He-ey!”

There is silence, until I speak. “She is wonderful,” I say.

The moment of meeting occurs when the mother realizes that her
baby’s behavior is specifically aimed toward her. This literally changes
the mother. It would be interesting to see brain imaging of these particular moments. This change in the mother translates into the fact that she
goes from commenting about the baby from the outside, as an observer
(“It is incredible! How wonderful!”), to speaking directly to her baby, as
a partner in their exchange (“Bianca, are you listening to me, my little
one? Are you listening to Mommy?”), even introducing herself to the
baby as her mother.

Lucas and His Parents

Lucas was born following an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth. Soon
after the birth, his parents discovered that their baby had a minor deformation of one foot; it was turned to the outside (in a valgus position).
This discovery was a shock and killed their joy in having a son who was
otherwise in good health. His deformed foot was all they could see.

During the Orientation interaction of the NBAS, Lucas showed a
capacity to maintain a prolonged alert state and a strong attraction to
the face, which he followed attentively from left to right, and up and
down. When his mother expressed the realization that he could see,

76 CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
Lucas immediately oriented his gaze toward her and repeated this
behavior an instant later.

These responses elicited intense emotion in his mother, who took
him in her arms and looked at him as if she had never realized until that
moment that, behind his deformed foot, there was a little guy eager for
her attention and her care. Another moment of meeting.

This situation illustrates the unfolding of the attachment process
along the steps described earlier. The discovery of an imperfect baby
stopped the attachment process in its tracks. The parents were paralyzed.
Having discovered that their infant was alive, the discovery of a baby
who was not totally intact froze the unfolding of the attachment process
(fight, flight, or freeze).

The question of the utility of such a defense in the case of a very
grave pathology remains open. In this case of a very minor physical
malformation, it was urgent to unblock the situation by revealing to the
parents the clear and quiet signals that their infant is a whole person.
This step allowed them to resume the attachment process and start
relating to Lucas as their son.

Anton and His Parents

This third baby was filmed for the same television program mentioned
earlier. Anton has a twin brother, Daniel. They are slightly preterm
and in good health. As I began to administer the NBAS, the mother
stayed quite far away and made some comparisons with the other twin
that were not favorable to Anton.

I begin the Reflexes item of the NBAS. The mother is receptive but a
little anxious; she moves around. [My thoughts are presented in italics.]
I sense that there is a tension to relieve, but I’m not sure where it’s coming
from. I speak to the baby: “You have the hiccups!” I pause. I wonder if this
infant gets easily overwhelmed and whether I will be able to proceed very far
into the exam. During the pull-to-sit maneuver, the mother remarks that
Anton doesn’t hold his head as well as his brother, Daniel. I answer,
“Yes, and here, have you seen? He also makes an effort to bring it forward.” The mother is worried about her baby not being strong enough. Is
Daniel seen as the half full glass and Anton as the half empty one?

The father watches the exam attentively, and he acts supportive
toward his wife; he puts his arm around her after her anxious utterance.

I am trying to have a contact with Anton. I position him facing me
and say, “Hello! Are you going to wake up?” He has the hiccups again.
I pause again. Anton’s father encourages him briefly. The mother goes
behind me and comes back to my other side, away from her husband.
The mother is anxious. She asks, “Why does one of the twins open his
eyes a lot and the other one much less?” I listen, and she goes on,
“Because the other baby keeps his eyes open all the time, but not him.
When I feed Daniel, he gazes at me all the time, but not Anton.” The
mother feels recognized by Daniel and bound with him, but not in the same
way with Anton; and this may be what is behind her anxiety.
