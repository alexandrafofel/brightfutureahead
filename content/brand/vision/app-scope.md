## :jigsaw: How it works – UX flow
1. **Welcome** – two clear choices
   **➊ Situation quiz** (60-sec ask) **➋ “Get to know us”** (full form)
2. **Profile form** – family & child routine, attachment, trauma → builds the *ideal family therapist* model (Brazelton + Bowlby).
3. **Smart analysis** – calming loader (“Breathe, we’re processing securely”); Freemium = background analysis, Premium = full visual report.
4. **Emotion & topic dashboard** – buttons (Anger, Tantrums, Anxiety, Sleep, Nutrition…) each offering:
   - **Bite-size guidance** tailored to profile
   - **Connection activities** parent-child
   - **Specialised chatbot** (free token limit / subscription)
5. **Chatbot “Ask ME Anything”** – GPT fine-tuned on Brazelton/Bowlby, emotion-specific mini-models (“Fear-Bot”, “Sleep-Bot”).
6. **Future add-ons** – Behaviour video analysis, secure group chat, “Friends on App-Name”, weekly personalised newsletter.
