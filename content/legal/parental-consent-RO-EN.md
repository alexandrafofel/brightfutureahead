**Who are we?**  
HeartNest is operated by [Company Name] (VAT/CUI 123456, Reg. No. J00/0000/2025), with its registered office at [address], and is dedicated to supporting parents of children aged 0 to 6.

**What data do we collect?**  
Only your child’s age bracket (0–1, 1–2 … 5–6 years) and a few answers about daily routine and behaviour. We do not ask for names, photos, location, or any other data that could directly identify your child.

**Why?**  
This strictly necessary information allows our AI system — built on verified sources and peer-reviewed studies — to give you explanations and activities matched fully to each developmental stage. Without it we cannot personalise content.

**How do we protect data?**  
All data are encrypted in transit and at rest, never sold, and never used for advertising.  
We create no commercial or behavioural profiles.  
Data are automatically deleted after 24 months of inactivity or immediately on request.

**Your rights (GDPR Art. 8, COPPA §312.6):**  
You can view, correct, or delete data at any time from your account. Tap “Delete child data” and processing stops immediately; we permanently erase the information within 30 days. For questions, write to privacy@heartnest.app

**By ticking the box,** you confirm that you are the child’s parent, guardian, or a trusted professional, and give informed consent for this limited use of data to generate personalised content based on age and daily routine, in the child’s best interest, under GDPR and COPPA.

**By continuing**, you agree to our [Privacy Policy] and [Terms].
