**EMOTIONAL (validation)**

1. **<2 years**

I know it’s hard — and that’s okay. Growth spurts often disturb sleep; it’s not your fault.

Play soft white noise, hold your baby close, and breathe gently together.

Sometimes they need your touch, sometimes a short moment alone.

You’re safe here. You’re a good parent.

1. **2–3 years**

It’s tiring when bedtime turns into protest — I get it.

At this age, “no” is a way to feel in control.

Say gently what comes next: wash, story, lights off.

Stay close, calm, and kind — your calm helps theirs.

Breathe slowly. You’ve done enough for tonight.

1. **4–6 years**

Evenings can be tough — that’s normal.

Say warmly: “It’s bedtime now. Story, then lights off.”

Offer a small choice: the bear story or the fairy one.

Repeat once, softly, and stay near.

You’re calm, present, and enough — your child feels that.

**ANALYTIC (short explanations)**

1. **<2 years**

Growth and new skills (walking, standing, talking) can disturb sleep — it’s temporary.

Watch for sleepy signs and place them down “drowsy, not asleep.”

Play white noise, dim the light, keep a simple rhythm.

If crying grows, short comfort, then try again.

Sleep becomes safe when you stay calm.

1. **2–3 years**

At this age, bedtime refusal is part of learning — not defiance.

Keep a clear three-step routine: wash, story, lights off.

Use the same words every night; predictability brings calm.

If they resist, repeat the rule once, gently.

Consistency brings faster, calmer sleep.

1. **4–6 years**

Children this age seek control and clear patterns.

Set three steady steps: pyjamas → story → lights off.

Say simply: “After the story, lights go off — it’s rest time.”

Offer one choice (short story or song) and follow through.

Clear routines calm the mind and invite sleep.

**PRAGMATIC (action-focused)**

1. **<2 years**

Turn off the lights and play soft white noise.

Hold your baby for a minute, breathing slowly together.

When drowsy, place them in the crib.

If crying lasts over a minute, lift, comfort shortly, and try again.

Repeat up to three times — then rest. You’ve done enough.

1. **2–3 years**

Keep one fixed routine: wash → story → lights off.

Say calmly: “Story first, then lights off.”

Offer one choice: the bear story or the fairy one.

If they negotiate, repeat once and move on.

Same order three nights in a row. Clarity builds cooperation.

1. **4–6 years**

Say: “Story first, then lights off.”

Offer two options (story or song).

After that, repeat calmly: “Now lights off.”

No punishments, no long talks — just gentle order.

Consistency brings calm nights. You did well tonight.

**TIRED (low energy)**

1. **<2 years**

You’ve done enough for tonight.

Play soft white noise, hold them gently for a minute.

Lay them down when drowsy and take a slow breath.

If it doesn’t work, try again once in ten minutes.

No guilt. Rest is also care.

1. **2–3 years**

You’re exhausted — and that’s okay.

Do the short version: story → lights off.

If they protest, pause for a minute, then try once more.

Skip long talks, skip guilt.

Your rest matters. You’ve done enough.

1. **4–6 years**

Keep it simple: story → lights off.

Say calmly: “I hear you. After the story, lights off.”

Let them choose pyjamas — small control brings peace.

Repeat once, then silence.

You were gentle today. Tomorrow will be easier.

**SAFE / UNDECIDED (exploration)**

1. **<2 years**

No pressure tonight.

Try one thing: soft white noise and a gentle voice.

Watch for two nights — if it helps, keep it; if not, shift bedtime 10 min earlier.

You’re safe here. Small steps count.

1. **2–3 years**

Take it easy — no pressure.

Try one small change for three nights: shorter story or earlier bedtime.

See what helps and keep only that.

Breathe softly, you have time to learn what works.

Calm is your best guide.

1. **4–6 years**

It’s safe to try.

Pick one small change: either add a simple choice (pyjamas or story) or use the same bedtime phrase.

Keep it for three nights and notice if struggles fade.

No rush — each night is gentle practice.

You’ve started well. Keep your pace.
