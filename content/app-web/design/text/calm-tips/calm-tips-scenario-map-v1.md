|---|--------|------------|-----------|---------|----------------------------|
| 1 | **sleep** | emotional | 2–3 | `sleep_emotional_2_3` | It’s tiring when bedtime turns into protest — I get it. At this age, “no” is a way to feel in control. Say gently what comes next: wash, story, lights off. Stay close, calm, and kind — your calm helps theirs. Breathe slowly. You’ve done enough for tonight. |
| 2 | sleep | analytic | 4–6 | `sleep_analytic_4_6` | Children this age seek control and clear patterns. Set three steady steps: pyjamas → story → lights off. Say simply: “After the story, lights go off — it’s rest time.” Offer one choice (short story or song) and follow through. Clear routines calm the mind and invite sleep. |
| 3 | sleep | pragmatic | 2–3 | `sleep_pragmatic_2_3` | Keep one fixed routine: wash → story → lights off. Say calmly: “Story first, then lights off.” Offer one choice: the bear story or the fairy one. If they negotiate, repeat once and move on. Same order three nights in a row. Clarity builds cooperation. |
| 4 | sleep | tired | <2 | `sleep_tired_<2` | You’ve done enough for tonight. Play soft white noise, hold them gently for a minute. Lay them down when drowsy and take a slow breath. If it doesn’t work, try again once in ten minutes. No guilt. Rest is also care. |
| 5 | sleep | indecis | 4–6 | `sleep_indecis_4_6` | It’s safe to try. Pick one small change: either add a simple choice (pyjamas or story) or use the same bedtime phrase. Keep it for three nights and notice if struggles fade. No rush — each night is gentle practice. You’ve started well. Keep your pace. |
| 6 | **meals** | emotional | 2–3 | `meals_emotional_2_3` | It’s frustrating when “no” becomes their answer at meals. They’re learning independence and need small control — it’s healthy. Let them try feeding themselves, even if it gets messy. Offer two gentle options and smile — no pressure. Breathe slowly. Joy grows where freedom lives. |
| 7 | meals | analytic | 4–6 | `meals_analytic_4_6` | Children this age need routine and example, not insistence. Keep meals at regular times, without screens or rush. Let them decide how much to eat from what’s offered. Avoid pressure and negotiations — they block appetite. Your calm example teaches more than words. |
| 8 | meals | pragmatic | 4–6 | `meals_pragmatic_4_6` | Create a gentle ritual: set the table together, then eat without screens. Invite them to choose a veggie or help serve. Afterward, say: “Thank you for joining us.” No pressure, no bargaining — just repetition. Your calm builds appetite and trust. |
| 9 | meals | tired | 2–3 | `meals_tired_2_3` | You’re exhausted — and that’s okay. Keep it simple: one dish, one calm moment. Let them explore food without comments. If they refuse, breathe and say: “Okay, we’ll try tomorrow.” Connection matters more than an empty plate. |
| 10 | meals | indecis | 4–6 | `meals_indecis_4_6` | It’s safe to explore. Give them a small role: set the table or choose a veggie. Keep the same routine but add one warm touch — a short story or a joke. Notice if the mood shifts to calm. You’ve started beautifully. Meals are learned, not forced. |
| 11 | **limits** | emotional | 2–3 | `limits_emotional_2_3` | It’s overwhelming when they shout, hit, or say “no” to everything. This is how they learn where “I” ends and “you” begin. Say calmly: “I know you’re angry, but I can’t let you hit.” Stay calm and steady — your calm becomes their anchor. You’ve done enough for today. Consistency is stronger than control. |
| 12 | limits | analytic | 4–6 | `limits_analytic_4_6` | At this age, children test control and learn by imitation. Firm, steady boundaries reduce anxiety and bring predictability. Choose what matters most — skip minor fights. After the storm, talk briefly and clearly. Your calm is the model they’ll copy. |
| 13 | limits | pragmatic | 2–3 | `limits_pragmatic_2_3` | Get down to their eye level. Say: “I see you’re mad, but I can’t let you hit.” Stay near and quiet until the storm passes. Then offer one choice: “Water or a hug?” Repeat the same steps every time — predictability heals. |
| 14 | limits | tired | 4–6 | `limits_tired_4_6` | Skip the long talks. Say: “We’ll stop. We’ll talk when we’re calm.” Step back and breathe. You’ve offered structure and calm — that’s enough. Anger passes. Connection stays. |
| 15 | limits | indecis | 4–6 | `limits_indecis_4_6` | It’s safe to experiment. Try calm interruption + a short talk after. “We’re calm now. What can we do differently next time?” See how they respond to your steady tone. You’ve started well. Small steps change everything. |
| 16 | **cooperation** | emotional | <2 | `cooperation_emotional_<2` | I know it’s hard when your baby doesn’t seem to cooperate. At this age, “attention” isn’t something you demand — it’s something you create. Breathe slowly, speak softly, touch gently, and find their eyes. When they feel safe, their body relaxes and follows your rhythm. You’re enough. Connection matters more than control. |
| 17 | cooperation | analytic | 4–6 | `cooperation_analytic_4_6` | Children seek autonomy but still need steady guidance. Clear, consistent boundaries build safety. Raised voices block attention; calm voices invite it. Simple, step-by-step instructions work best. Children align when they feel seen, not forced. |
| 18 | cooperation | pragmatic | 2–3 | `cooperation_pragmatic_2_3` | Say clearly: “Now we put on shoes.” Offer a small choice: “You do it or I help?” When they cooperate, smile and name it: “You did it yourself!” If they refuse, repeat the same phrase once — calmly. Gentle repetition builds real cooperation. |
| 19 | cooperation | tired | 2–3 | `cooperation_tired_2_3` | It’s exhausting to repeat the same thing again and again. Say one line: “I love you, and the rule stays.” Then pause and breathe. If it doesn’t work tonight, it’s okay — you’ll try again tomorrow. Staying calm is already progress. |
| 20 | cooperation | indecis | 4–6 | `cooperation_indecis_4_6` | It’s safe to experiment. Try step-by-step instructions with gentle eye contact. “First we tidy up, then we read.” Notice if they respond better to your calm tone. Cooperation grows through gentle practice. |
