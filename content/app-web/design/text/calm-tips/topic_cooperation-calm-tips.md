# TOPIC- COOPERATION / ATTENTION

Status: Done

## 👩‍👦 Emotional (validation)

**<2 years**

I know it’s hard when your baby doesn’t seem to cooperate.

At this age, “attention” isn’t something you demand — it’s something you create.

Breathe slowly, speak softly, touch gently, and find their eyes.

When they feel safe, their body relaxes and follows your rhythm.

You’re enough. Connection matters more than control.

**2–3 years**

When “no” becomes their favorite word, they’re learning who they are.

Say calmly and simply what comes next: “Now we put on your jacket.”

Your gentle look means more than a long explanation.

Kind firmness helps their mind settle.

Stay close. You’re their safe anchor.

**4–6 years**

It’s tiring when every request turns into a negotiation.

At this age, listening grows from relationship, not control.

Look in their eyes, say their name, and ask for one clear step.

Your calm keeps their focus steady.

You’re consistent, present, and exactly what they need.

## 🧠 Analytic (short explanations)

**<2 years**

Early cooperation is built on synchrony, not rules.

A tired or overstimulated baby can’t respond well.

Follow their cues and adjust your pace.

Warm tone, touch, and eye contact spark attention.

Connection always comes before cooperation.

**2–3 years**

Between two and three, children test limits to learn control.

Short, calm, repeated messages work best.

Avoid harsh punishment or full isolation — they create fear, not learning.

Connect before you correct; closeness restores focus.

Gentle firmness leads to real cooperation.

**4–6 years**

Children seek autonomy but still need steady guidance.

Clear, consistent boundaries build safety.

Raised voices block attention; calm voices invite it.

Simple, step-by-step instructions work best.

Children align when they feel seen, not forced.

## 🛠️ Pragmatic (action steps)

**<2 years**

Move closer, make eye contact, and say softly: “Let’s do this together.”

If they turn away, wait a few seconds, then try again gently.

Use gestures and smiles instead of commands.

When their body softens, start the activity.

Right timing matters more than speed.

**2–3 years**

Say clearly: “Now we put on shoes.”

Offer a small choice: “You do it or I help?”

When they cooperate, smile and name it: “You did it yourself!”

If they refuse, repeat the same phrase once — calmly.

Gentle repetition builds real cooperation.

**4–6 years**

Look at them, say their name, and give one clear task: “Please bring your book.”

Wait a few seconds before repeating.

If they drift off, touch their shoulder gently and remind them.

When they cooperate, thank them genuinely.

Appreciation builds focus better than correction.

## 😴 Tired (low energy)

**<2 years**

You’ve done enough for today.

If they resist, breathe and let the moment pass.

Try again later with a softer tone.

No effort is wasted — your calm is what matters.

You’re a good parent, even on hard days.

**2–3 years**

It’s exhausting to repeat the same thing again and again.

Say one line: “I love you, and the rule stays.”

Then pause and breathe.

If it doesn’t work tonight, it’s okay — you’ll try again tomorrow.

Staying calm is already progress.

**4–6 years**

When you’re out of patience, stop everything.

Say: “Let’s pause. We’ll talk when we’re calm.”

Stay nearby, in silence if needed.

Your child needs presence, not perfection.

You’ve done enough. Rest now.

## 🌀 Safe / Indecisive (exploration)

**<2 years**

No pressure.

Pick a calm moment and notice how they respond to your soft voice.

Wait a few seconds before asking for something.

See what works best — eye contact, touch, or smile.

It’s safe to explore. Little discoveries matter.

**2–3 years**

Try one new thing: connect before you ask.

Say: “Look at me. Let’s do this together.”

If it works, repeat it for three days.

If not, adjust your tone — softer, shorter.

No rush. You’re learning what fits your child.

**4–6 years**

It’s safe to experiment.

Try step-by-step instructions with gentle eye contact.

“First we tidy up, then we read.”

Notice if they respond better to your calm tone.

Cooperation grows through gentle practice.
