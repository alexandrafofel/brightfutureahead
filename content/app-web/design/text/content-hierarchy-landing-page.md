\- \*\*Minimal form fields:\*\* Only email; collect more later.

\- \*\*Tone \& design:\*\* Calming colours, ample whitespace, empathetic copy.

\## ✅ Rationale

\- Clear value proposition in headline \& CTA.  

\- Empathetic, soothing, trustworthy tone (aligned with \[Tone-of-Voice One-Pager]:contentReference\[oaicite:0]{index=0}).  

\- Explicit value exchange in microcopy (“get your personalised tip \& invite”), boosting conversion:contentReference\[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  

\- GDPR compliance: simple, plain language, and standalone consent:contentReference\[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
