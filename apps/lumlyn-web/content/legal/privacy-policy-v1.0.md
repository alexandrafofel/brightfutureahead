1. Who collects your data
The Lumlyn app is operated by Lumlyn OÜ, a company registered in Estonia, with its registered office at [full address].

2. What data we collect
We follow the principle of data minimization (GDPR Art. 5).
We only collect the information strictly necessary:
Account data: email, password.
Child data: age group (0–1, 1–2 … 5–6 years).
Answers to questions about behaviour and family (e.g., daily routines, sleep patterns, emotional responses).
Technical data: IP address, device type.
App usage: questions sent to the chatbot, modules accessed.
We do not collect: names, photos, exact location, or other data that could directly identify a child.

Cookies
The app uses cookies and similar technologies:
Strictly necessary: enable core functions (e.g., login, keeping sessions active, language choice). These cannot be disabled.
Analytics (optional): help us understand how the app is used and improve it (e.g., number of visits, time spent in a module). These cookies are only activated if you give consent through the checkbox.
You can withdraw your consent for analytics cookies at any time, from the app settings or by contacting privacy@lumlyn.com.

3. Legal basis for processing
Parents / guardians: explicit consent (GDPR Art. 6(1)(a)).
Educators / schools: in the EU/UK, processing is based on the contract between the school and the parent (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b)), or for public institutions, on public interest in education (GDPR Art. 6(1)(e)). In the US, we also apply the School Exception under COPPA.
Therapists / clinics: processing is based on the contract with the parent (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b)) or on legitimate interest (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)); therapists are required to invite the parent to confirm consent.

4. Why we use the data
This strictly necessary information enables our AI system — built on verified sources and validated scientific research — to provide personalised guidance tailored to developmental stages.
We do not use data for commercial profiling or marketing.

5. How we protect the data
Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
Access is restricted to the Lumlyn founding team only.
