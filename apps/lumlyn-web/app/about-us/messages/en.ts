       intro: 
              "Lumlyn was born from a real and deeply personal need. We are two mothers of energetic boys who, like many of you, wanted to raise our children with care – guided by science and by our loving intuition.",

       problem: 
              "In the beginning, we searched for answers in books, forums, and from specialists. But instead of clarity, we often found contradictory advice, overwhelming information, and even judgment. Instead of support, we faced guilt and self-doubt – experiences that left us discouraged. " +
              "Rather than give up, we chose to build what was missing: a safe, warm, and carefully guided space for parents everywhere. We started with a simple question: What if parents always had access to trusted support, grounded in science and empathy?",

       solution:
              "Out of love for children and deep respect for parents, educators, and therapists, we turned that question into a mission. Today, Lumlyn is a global platform where families can find both practical guidance and emotional support, knowing they are never alone on this journey. ",
  
       mission: 
              "✨ Our story is just beginning, but the essence will never change: Lumlyn exists to empower parents to raise happy, balanced children.",
